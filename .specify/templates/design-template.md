# Design Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature**: `[###-feature-name]`
**Design Date**: [DATE]
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md` and implementation plan from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/plan.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.design` command. See `.claude/commands/speckit.design.md` for the execution workflow.

## Overview

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Brief description of the feature UI/UX approach.
  Focus on visual design decisions and user interaction patterns.
-->

[Brief description of the feature's visual design approach and key interaction patterns]

## Component Architecture

<!--
  REUSABILITY RULE: Check existing → Common (2+ features) → Feature-specific (1 feature)
  - Common → packages/ui/src/components/
  - Feature → packages/ui/src/features/[feature-name]/
-->

### Component Reusability Assessment

**Existing components checked**:
- [Component] - ✅ Reused / ⚡ Extended / ❌ N/A

**Component categorization**:

| Component | Location | Reusability Rationale |
|-----------|----------|----------------------|
| FileUpload | `components/` | Used in 3+ features |
| Screen1 | `features/[feature]/` | Feature-specific screen |

**Created**:

Common (if any) in `packages/ui/src/components/`:
- [CommonComponent].tsx - [Why cross-feature reusable]

Feature-specific in `packages/ui/src/features/[feature-name]/`:
- Screen1.tsx, Screen2.tsx - [Purpose]

**Import paths**:
- Common: `import { X } from '@centrid/ui/components'`
- Feature: `import { Y } from '@centrid/ui/features'`

### Design System Showcase

**Location**: `apps/design-system/pages/[feature-name]/`

**Routes**:
- http://localhost:3001/[feature-name]/ (overview)
- http://localhost:3001/[feature-name]/screen-1
- http://localhost:3001/[feature-name]/screen-2
- http://localhost:3001/[feature-name]/screen-3

### Screen-to-Component Mapping

<!--
  CRITICAL: This table is used by /speckit.tasks to generate implementation tasks.
  Each row maps a screen to its component file and screenshots.
  Ensure all paths are accurate and screenshots exist.
-->

| Screen Name | Component File | Showcase Route | Screenshots |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| [Screen 1 Name] | `Screen1.tsx` | `/[feature-name]/screen-1` | `01-screen-1-desktop.png`, `01-screen-1-mobile.png` |
| [Screen 2 Name] | `Screen2.tsx` | `/[feature-name]/screen-2` | `02-screen-2-desktop.png`, `02-screen-2-mobile.png` |
| [Screen 3 Name] | `Screen3.tsx` | `/[feature-name]/screen-3` | `03-screen-3-desktop.png`, `03-screen-3-mobile.png` |

### Primitives Used (from @centrid/ui/components)

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: List all shadcn/ui primitives used in this feature.
  This helps track component dependencies.
-->

- Button (variants: default, secondary, ghost)
- Input (with validation states)
- Card (for containers)
- Badge (for status indicators)
- Dialog (for modals)
- [Add other primitives used]

## Test Prerequisites

<!--
  CRITICAL: Used by /speckit.verify-ui to setup test environment before running flows.
  If your feature requires any setup (auth, test data, etc), document steps here.
  Keep steps concise and executable.
-->

**Prerequisites** (if any):
1. [Step to setup - e.g., "Login with test@centrid.local / TestPassword123!"]
2. [Another step - e.g., "Navigate to /workspace"]

**Skip this section if**: Feature has no prerequisites (works without auth, test data, etc)

---

## User Flows

<!--
  CRITICAL: These flows are used by /speckit.verify-ui for automated acceptance testing.
  Each flow must:
  - Map to acceptance criteria from spec.md
  - Reference specific components and routes
  - Include Playwright selectors (use data-testid attributes)
  - Define success criteria
  - Document error scenarios
  - Include test data (valid + invalid cases)
-->

### Flow 1: [Descriptive Flow Name]

**Maps to**: [User Story/Acceptance Criterion ID from spec.md - e.g., "User Story 1", "SC-001"]

**Goal**: [What user accomplishes - should match acceptance criteria]

**Priority**: [P1/P2/P3 - from spec.md user story]

**Starting Route**: `/[production-route]` ([Screen Name])

**Steps**:

1. **Action**: [User action - Click, Type, Fill, Drag, Upload, etc.]
   - **Component**: `ComponentName` from `ScreenX.tsx`
   - **Selector**: `[data-testid="element-id"]` (preferred) or `.class-name`
   - **Expected Behavior**: [What happens immediately after action]
   - **Playwright**: `await page.click('[data-testid="element-id"]')`

2. **Action**: [Next user action]
   - **Component**: `ComponentName` from `ScreenY.tsx`
   - **Selector**: `[data-testid="input-field"]`
   - **Expected Behavior**: [What happens]
   - **Playwright**: `await page.fill('[data-testid="input-field"]', 'test value')`

3. **Action**: [Next user action]
   - **Component**: `ComponentName`
   - **Selector**: `[data-testid="submit-button"]`
   - **Expected Behavior**: [Loading state appears, then success state]
   - **Playwright**: `await page.click('[data-testid="submit-button"]')`

[Continue for all steps in the flow...]

**Success Criteria** (from spec.md):
- ✅ [Measurable outcome 1 - e.g., "Action completes in < 5 seconds"]
- ✅ [Measurable outcome 2 - e.g., "Result appears in sidebar"]
- ✅ [Measurable outcome 3 - e.g., "Success message displayed"]

**Error Scenarios**:
- **[Error Type]**: [Expected error message and UI state - e.g., "Invalid file type: 'Only PDF, TXT, MD supported'"]
- **[Error Type]**: [Expected error message - e.g., "File too large: 'File must be under 10MB'"]
- **[Error Type]**: [Expected error message - e.g., "Network error: Retry button appears"]

**Test Data**:
- **Valid**: [Sample data that should succeed - e.g., "test-document.pdf (2MB)"]
- **Invalid Type**: [Sample data for error scenario - e.g., "test.exe"]
- **Invalid Size**: [Sample data for error scenario - e.g., "large-file.pdf (15MB)"]

**Screenshots**:
- Success: `flow-1-success-desktop.png`, `flow-1-success-mobile.png`
- Error: `flow-1-error-[type]-desktop.png`

### Flow 2: [Next Flow Name]

**Maps to**: [User Story/SC ID from spec.md]

**Goal**: [User goal]

**Priority**: [P1/P2/P3]

**Starting Route**: `/[route]` ([Screen Name])

**Steps**:
[Same detailed structure as Flow 1...]

**Success Criteria** (from spec.md):
- ✅ [Criterion 1]
- ✅ [Criterion 2]

**Error Scenarios**:
- **[Error Type]**: [Expected message]

**Test Data**:
- **Valid**: [Data]
- **Invalid**: [Data]

## Design Principles Verification

<!--
  CRITICAL: Verify against .specify/DESIGN-PRINCIPLES.md (10 levers for perfect UI).
  These principles ensure cohesive, beautiful, usable interfaces.
-->

- [ ] **Visual Hierarchy**: Primary actions prominent (size, color, weight, position), clear focal points, no competing elements
- [ ] **Consistency**: Design tokens used throughout (spacing, colors, typography), no arbitrary values, predictable patterns
- [ ] **Information Density**: Appropriate for feature type (data-dense vs. content-focused), progressive disclosure where needed
- [ ] **Color with Purpose**: Semantic colors correct (success=green, error=red, warning=yellow), brand color used sparingly
- [ ] **Typography Hierarchy**: Clear heading levels (H1 > H2 > H3 > Body), scannable text structure, minimum 16px body text
- [ ] **Spacing Rhythm**: 8px grid system maintained, consistent gaps between similar elements, mathematical spacing
- [ ] **Feedback & Affordance**: All interactive elements have hover/focus/active/disabled states, transitions smooth (150-250ms)
- [ ] **Mobile-First Responsive**: Layouts intentional at all breakpoints (not just "cramped desktop"), touch targets 44x44px minimum
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Contrast ratios meet WCAG AA (4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI), keyboard navigation logical, focus indicators visible
- [ ] **States Coverage**: Loading, error, empty, success states designed and intentional

**Reference**: See `.specify/DESIGN-PRINCIPLES.md` for detailed guidance on each lever.

## Implementation Notes

<!--
  CRITICAL: Essential handoff information for /speckit.tasks and /speckit.implement.
  Detailed implementation tasks will be generated by /speckit.tasks.
-->

**Container Pattern**: Implementation creates containers in `apps/web/src/components/[feature]/` that wrap designed components with business logic (hooks, state, API calls).

**Import Paths**:
- Common components: `import { FileUpload } from '@centrid/ui/components'`
- Feature components: `import { Screen1, Screen2 } from '@centrid/ui/features'`

**Key Principle**: Designed components are pure presentational. Containers add all business logic, data fetching, and state management.

  VALIDATION GATE: All items must pass before design.md is considered complete.
  This checklist is verified by /speckit.design in Step 6.
