## Next Steps

**If Status = PASS ‚úÖ**:

All acceptance criteria met and all flows working as expected. Feature verification complete.

**Next Action**:
```bash
/speckit.analyze [###-feature-name]
```

This will perform cross-artifact consistency analysis before marking feature complete.

---

**If Status = PARTIAL ‚ö†Ô∏è**:

Some flows passed but issues were found that should be addressed.

**Required Actions**:
1. Review major issues and determine if they should be fixed before release
2. Address critical issues if any
3. Re-run verification after fixes:
   ```bash
   /speckit.verify-ui [###-feature-name]
   ```

---

**If Status = FAIL ‚ùå**:

Critical issues found that prevent feature completion.

**Required Actions**:
1. **Fix critical issues** (listed above in Issues Summary):
   - [Issue 1]: [Brief action needed]
   - [Issue 2]: [Brief action needed]

2. **Address major issues** (recommended):
   - [Issue 1]: [Action needed]

3. **Re-run verification** after fixes:
   ```bash
   /speckit.verify-ui [###-feature-name]
   ```

4. **Do NOT proceed** to `/speckit.analyze` until verification passes
