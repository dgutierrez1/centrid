# Centrid - Strategic Marketing Plan

**Version**: 3.0 (Context-First Positioning)  
**Date**: 2025-01-15  
**Status**: Ready for Execution  
**Marketing Philosophy**: Focused Execution + Direct Distribution + Rapid Validation

> **Core Positioning**: AI for knowledge work with persistent context - eliminate context fragmentation across conversations

---

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### The Core Strategy

**The Reality**: Most indie products fail not from bad products, but from bad distribution. We'll win by extreme focus on high-ROI channels and relentless iteration.

**The 3-Stage Approach**:

1. **Stage 0→$1**: Manual outreach, direct sales, prove someone will pay
2. **Stage $1→$1K MRR**: Double down on what worked, systematic execution
3. **Stage $1K→$10K MRR**: Scale winning channels, expand strategically

**The Goal**: $10K MRR within 12 months with profitable unit economics from day one

---

## 🧠 THE MARKETING SUCCESS FRAMEWORK

### The Mental Model: Distribution > Product

**Core Principle**: "The best product doesn't win. The product with the best distribution wins."

**The Framework**:

```
1. HYPOTHESIS → 2. TEST → 3. MEASURE → 4. DECIDE → 5. SCALE or KILL
     ↓              ↓           ↓            ↓              ↓
  "X channel    Run for     Track exact    ROI > 3:1?    Go all-in
  will work"    1 week      conversions    Yes/No        or stop
```

**Critical Rules**:

1. **Focus Fire**: Do ONE channel extremely well beats doing 10 channels poorly
2. **Speed Wins**: Fast iteration > perfect execution. Ship, measure, adjust in days not weeks
3. **Direct Sales First**: Talk to customers before scaling. Understand objections, refine messaging
4. **Profitable from $1**: Never lose money to acquire customers. Bootstrap mentality
5. **Follow Energy**: Double down on what's working, kill what's not (be ruthless)

**The "Rule of 7" Testing Framework**:

- Test channel for exactly 7 days
- If < 7 leads, kill it
- If 7-20 leads, iterate and retest
- If 20+ leads, double down

**Success Indicators at Each Stage**:

- **Stage 0→$1**: Someone pays you (any amount proves value)
- **Stage $1→$1K**: Repeatable acquisition (you know WHERE customers come from)
- **Stage $1K→$10K**: Profitable scaling (acquire customers profitably without you doing everything)

## 🎯 TARGET AUDIENCE & POSITIONING

### Who Actually Pays for This?

**The Painful Truth**: We're targeting power AI users experiencing context fragmentation.

**Primary Target (80% of focus)**: **Knowledge Workers & Power AI Users**

Specific personas:

1. **Heavy ChatGPT/Claude Users** experiencing context re-explanation pain daily
2. **Content Creators** managing research, drafts, and multiple projects across AI conversations
3. **Consultants & Analysts** working with client documents and needing AI for insights
4. **Researchers** (academic, market, user) managing large document collections with AI
5. **Indie Hackers** building products who need AI assistance across multiple work streams

**Why These People?**:

- Already paying $20-40/month for AI tools (ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro)
- Experience context fragmentation daily (spending 10-15 min per conversation re-explaining)
- Have clear pain: "I constantly copy-paste context to ChatGPT and lose track of conversations"
- Willing to pay premium ($25/month) for reduced friction
- Can self-serve (tech-savvy, understand AI tools)
- Active on Twitter/Reddit/HN/AI communities (reachable for free)

**The ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)**:

- **Age**: 25-45
- **Income**: $60K-200K (can afford $25/month without approval)
- **Behavior**: Uses ChatGPT Plus or Claude Pro daily (10+ conversations/day), manages 10+ document files for work
- **Pain Level**: 8/10 - actively experiencing context fragmentation daily
- **Budget**: Already paying $20-40/month for AI subscriptions, willing to consolidate or add tools

### Positioning Strategy

**One-Liner (Use Everywhere)**:
"AI For Knowledge Work With Persistent Context. Stop Re-Explaining Context. Start Working Smarter."

**Why This Works**:

- Directly addresses the core pain (context re-explanation)
- Clear benefit (persistent context across conversations)
- Proven "Stop/Start" pattern converts well
- Targets knowledge workers (broader than just developers)
- Differentiates from ChatGPT (which loses context between chats)

**Alternative Positioning Tests** (A/B test these):

**Option A - Pain-First**:
"Tired of Re-Explaining Context Every Time? AI For Knowledge Work With Persistent Context."

**Option B - vs ChatGPT**:
"ChatGPT forces you to re-explain context every conversation. Centrid: upload once, use across unlimited chats."

**Option C - Knowledge Worker Focused**:
"Research. Create. Analyze. Decide. AI For Knowledge Work That Maintains Context."

### Messaging by Channel

**Hacker News**: "Built this because I'm tired of re-explaining context to ChatGPT. Multi-chat system with persistent document context via RAG + pgvector."

**Product Hunt**: "AI for knowledge work with persistent context: upload documents once, access across unlimited chats, never re-explain"

**Reddit (r/ChatGPT, r/ClaudeAI)**: "Tired of copy-pasting documents to ChatGPT? I built persistent context across conversations"

**Twitter**: "Stop re-explaining context every conversation. Persistent document context across unlimited AI chats."

**LinkedIn**: "Persistent context architecture for knowledge workers: eliminate context fragmentation in AI workflows"

---

## 💰 STAGE 1: $0 → FIRST DOLLAR (Week 1-2)

**Objective**: Prove ONE person will pay real money for this product

**Why This Matters**: Until someone pays, you have a hobby, not a business. This validates the entire concept.

### The Strategy: Manual Everything

**DO NOT**:

- Build landing pages with fancy animations
- Write blog posts
- Create social media accounts
- Build for scale
- Try to automate anything

**DO THIS INSTEAD**:

- Find 10 people who have the exact pain
- Show them the product (Loom video is enough)
- Ask for money BEFORE they use it
- Get feedback, iterate, repeat

### Exact Execution Plan (Days 1-14)

**Day 1-2: Build Hit List**

Create spreadsheet with 50 prospects:

**Where to Find Them**:

1. **Twitter Search**:
   - Search: "ChatGPT context"
   - Search: "tired of re-explaining"
   - Search: "copy paste ChatGPT"
   - Search: "ChatGPT loses context"
   - Find power users complaining about context issues
2. **Reddit Scraping**:

   - r/ChatGPT - anyone complaining about context limitations
   - r/ClaudeAI - users discussing context management
   - r/productivity - search "AI workflow" or "ChatGPT"
   - r/consulting - consultants using AI for client work

3. **AI Tool Communities**:

   - ChatGPT Plus subscribers discussing limitations
   - Claude Pro users on Twitter/Discord
   - AI productivity tool enthusiasts

4. **LinkedIn**:
   - Search "Consultant" + "AI tools"
   - Search "Content Creator" + "ChatGPT"
   - Search "Researcher" + "AI"
   - Filter by 2nd connections (easier outreach)

**Spreadsheet Columns**:

```
Name | Platform | Profile URL | Specific Pain Mentioned | Outreach Status | Response | Result
```

**Day 3-5: Outreach Wave 1 (20 people)**

**The DM Template** (Customize per person):

```
Hey [Name],

Saw your tweet about [context re-explanation pain with ChatGPT]. I literally built something for this.

Persistent document context across unlimited chats - upload once, never re-explain. Like having ChatGPT that actually remembers your documents.

7-day free trial, no credit card. Would you try it?

[Link to quick Loom demo - 90 seconds]

- [Your name]
```

**Critical Details**:

- Mention their SPECIFIC pain (re-explaining context)
- Compare to ChatGPT (they use it daily)
- No credit card for trial (removes friction)
- Keep it under 50 words
- Include Loom demo (show don't tell)

**The Loom Demo Script** (Record once, use for everyone):

1. "Hey, I'm [name], I built Centrid because I'm tired of re-explaining context to ChatGPT"
2. [30 seconds showing pain: copy-pasting same document to ChatGPT 5 times, losing track of conversations]
3. "Here's Centrid: upload documents once, create unlimited chats, all have persistent context"
4. [45 seconds showing: upload docs → create multiple chats → each chat has full document access → never re-explain]
5. "7-day free trial, no credit card. Then $25/month if it saves you time. Link below."
6. "Questions? DM me anytime."

**Day 6-8: Follow-ups**

- No response after 48 hours → One follow-up: "Curious if you saw this? No worries if not interested."
- After that, move on (don't spam)

**Day 9-10: Outreach Wave 2 (30 people)**

- Same process, refined based on Wave 1 responses
- Track what messaging gets responses
- Adjust demo based on questions

**Day 11-14: Close First Customer**

**When someone says "yes"**:

1. Send Stripe payment link immediately
2. After payment, give them access
3. Follow up in 24 hours: "How's it going? What's confusing?"
4. Follow up in 48 hours: "Create anything useful yet?"
5. Follow up in 7 days: "Worth the $10? Would you pay $19/month?"

### Success Metrics (Week 2 Checkpoint)

**Minimum Success**:

- ✅ 1 paying customer (any amount)
- ✅ 5+ responses to outreach
- ✅ Clear understanding of top 3 objections

**Good Success**:

- ✅ 3-5 paying customers
- ✅ 10+ conversations
- ✅ 2-3 customers actively using product daily

**Failure Indicators**:

- ❌ 0 responses to outreach → Your targeting is wrong or messaging is broken
- ❌ Lots of interest but no one pays → Pricing is too high or value is unclear
- ❌ People pay but don't use it → Onboarding is broken or product doesn't solve the pain

### What to Learn in Stage 1

**Critical Questions to Answer**:

1. What exact words do customers use to describe their pain?
2. What's the #1 objection to paying?
3. Which positioning resonates most? (Cursor for docs vs Stop using ChatGPT vs Obsidian alternative)
4. What's the minimum they find valuable? (Just AI agents? Must have mobile? Need search?)
5. What's the willingness to pay? ($10? $19? $29?)

**Document Everything**:

- Every conversation
- Every objection
- What made them say "yes"
- What features they ask for

This intel is gold for Stage 2.

---

## 📈 STAGE 2: $1 → $1,000 MRR (Weeks 3-10)

**Objective**: Find repeatable, scalable acquisition channel. Build systematic marketing machine.

**Target**: 50-70 paying customers at $19/month = $1,000 MRR

### The Strategy: Double Down + Systemize

**What Changes from Stage 1**:

- Move from 1:1 outreach to 1:many distribution

### Week 5-10: Channel Testing & Scaling

**The Rule**: Test one channel per week. Measure ruthlessly. Keep or kill.

#### Week 5: Hacker News Launch

**Why This Channel**: Direct access to technical audience, free, high-leverage if it works

**Exact Execution**:

**Day 1 - Monday 8am PST** (Best day/time for HN):

**Post Title** (Test these variations):

- "Show HN: AI agents for markdown knowledge bases (like Cursor for documents)"
- "Show HN: I got tired of copying context to ChatGPT, so I built AI agents for my docs"
- "Show HN: Mobile-first AI workspace for technical documentation"

**Post Structure**:

```
Title: Show HN: [Your chosen variation]

Body:
Hey HN,

I'm [name], and I spent the last 8 weeks building Centrid.

**The Problem**: I was constantly copying markdown files to ChatGPT for editing/analysis, but it never remembered my previous docs or writing style. Obsidian's mobile app is unusable. Notion is too slow for quick mobile edits.

**The Solution**: AI agents that live in your knowledge base. Upload your markdown files, agents understand the entire context, create/edit/research documents on any device.

**Tech Stack**: Next.js, Supabase (pgvector), OpenAI embeddings for RAG, runs as PWA for mobile-first experience.

**Current State**: 5 paying users, $95 MRR, launched 2 weeks ago. Getting great feedback on [specific feature].

**What I'd love feedback on**:
- Is "Cursor for documents" a clear positioning?
- Would you use this for [use case]?
- What's your biggest hesitation about AI writing tools?

Try it: [link]
(First 50 HN users: 50% off lifetime with code HN50)

Happy to answer questions about the RAG implementation, vector search strategy, or anything else!
```

**Critical Success Factors**:

- Post between 8-10am PST (highest traffic)
- Respond to EVERY comment within first 2 hours (engagement boosts ranking)
- Be technical but approachable
- Offer HN-specific discount (creates urgency, tracks conversions)
- Link to landing page AND live demo

**Expected Results**:

- **Good**: 50-100 points, 30+ comments, 20+ signups, 5+ paying customers
- **Acceptable**: 20-50 points, 15+ comments, 10+ signups, 2+ paying customers
- **Failure**: <20 points, <10 comments → messaging problem or product not interesting to HN

#### Week 6: Product Hunt Launch

**Why This Channel**: Startup/productivity-focused audience, built-in distribution, badge credibility

**Pre-Launch** (2 weeks before):

1. **Find a Hunter** (Someone with 1000+ followers on PH)

   - Search "AI productivity" on Product Hunt
   - DM top hunters: "I'm launching an AI workspace product on [date]. Would you hunt it?"
   - Offer: Early access + lifetime Pro

2. **Prepare Assets**:
   - 3-5 screenshots (mobile + desktop views)
   - Demo GIF (15 seconds, auto-playing)
   - Thumbnail image (240x240)
   - Tagline (exactly 60 characters or less)
   - Description (first 260 characters are visible without "read more")

**Launch Day - Tuesday** (Best day for PH):

**Tagline Options** (A/B test with hunter):

- "AI agents for markdown knowledge bases - Cursor for documents"
- "Create technical docs 10x faster with AI agents"
- "Stop copying context to ChatGPT. AI knows your knowledge base"

**Description First 260 Characters** (Critical - shown in feed):

```
Centrid is an AI workspace for markdown files. Upload your docs, AI agents understand your entire knowledge base, create/edit/research content on any device. Built for developers, writers, and knowledge workers who need mobile-first productivity.
```

**Launch Schedule**:

- 12:01am PST: Go live (PH resets at midnight)
- 6am-10am: Peak engagement window - respond to every comment
- Share on Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit (without being spammy)
- Email your existing customers asking for upvotes (if they're willing)

**Engagement Strategy**:

- Respond to every comment personally within 30 minutes
- Thank everyone for feedback
- Address objections directly
- Offer Product Hunt exclusive: "PRODUCTHUNT" code for 30% off

**Expected Results**:

- **Great**: Top 5 of the day, 300+ upvotes, 50+ signups, 10+ paying customers
- **Good**: Top 10 of the day, 150+ upvotes, 30+ signups, 5+ paying customers
- **Acceptable**: Top 20 of the day, 75+ upvotes, 15+ signups, 2+ paying customers

#### Week 7: Reddit Strategy

**Why This Channel**: Hyper-targeted communities, free, high conversion if done right

**The Rule**: Give value first, promote second. Reddit hates obvious promotion.

**Target Subreddits**:

1. r/ObsidianMD (100K+ members, your exact audience)
2. r/productivity (2M+ members, broad reach)
3. r/SideProject (200K+ indie hackers)
4. r/markdown (smaller but highly targeted)
5. r/developertools (smaller but high-intent)

**Posting Strategy** (Different angle per subreddit):

**r/ObsidianMD Post**:

```
Title: "Built a mobile-first alternative after getting frustrated with Obsidian's mobile app"

Hey everyone, long-time Obsidian user here. Love the desktop app, but the mobile experience has always been painful for me.

After months of frustration, I built Centrid - mobile-first markdown editor with AI agents. Curious what this community thinks since you're the markdown power users.

Key differences from Obsidian:
- PWA-first (works offline, installs like app)
- AI agents that understand your entire vault
- Real-time sync without plugins
- Touch-optimized UI (built for mobile from day 1)

Not trying to replace Obsidian for everyone - desktop experience is still king there. But for people like me who need mobile-first workflows, this has been game-changing.

Would love feedback from this community: [link to demo/landing page]

PS: Happy to answer questions about the AI implementation or how it compares to Obsidian plugins.
```

**Critical Reddit Rules**:

- DO NOT post same content to multiple subreddits same day (Reddit will shadowban)
- Space posts out: Day 1 (r/ObsidianMD), Day 3 (r/SideProject), Day 5 (r/productivity)
- Engage authentically - answer questions, don't just promote
- If mods remove post, don't argue - DM and ask how to adjust
- Track which subreddit converts best, double down there

**Expected Results Per Subreddit**:

- **r/ObsidianMD**: 50-200 upvotes, 10-20 signups, 2-4 paying customers
- **r/SideProject**: 20-100 upvotes, 15-30 signups, 3-5 paying customers
- **r/productivity**: 100-500 upvotes (bigger sub), 20-40 signups, 3-6 paying customers

#### Week 8: Twitter Build-in-Public

**Why This Channel**: Direct access to indie hacker/developer community, free, compounds over time

**The Strategy**: Document your journey, share learnings, attract audience organically

**Daily Posting Schedule**:

**Monday**: Weekly update

```
Week [X] building Centrid:
- MRR: $XXX (+X%)
- New customers: X
- Biggest win: [specific thing]

```

**Wednesday**: Customer story (anonymized if needed)

```
Customer use case 🔥

"I was spending 3 hours/week writing API docs manually. Now it takes 20 minutes with Centrid's AI agents."

This is why we build.

[Screenshot of conversation/testimonial]
```

**Thursday**: Behind-the-scenes

```
Reality of bootstrapping [product]:

Expected: Work 8 hours, ship features, growth 📈
Reality:
- 2 hours actual coding
- 3 hours customer support
- 2 hours fixing bugs
- 1 hour marketing
- 0 hours sleep

Worth it though.
```

**Friday**: Lesson learned

```
Lesson from this week:

❌ Built [feature] no one asked for
✅ Should have just talked to customers

Wasted 10 hours. But learned: customer feedback > my assumptions.

What's a lesson you learned the hard way?
```

**Engagement Strategy**:

- Reply to every comment on your tweets
- Engage with other indie hackers' posts (support others)
- Use relevant hashtags: #buildinpublic #indiehackers #AItools
- Tag relevant accounts when appropriate (but don't spam)

**Thread Strategy** (Once per week):

**Example Thread**:

```
How I got my first 10 paying customers for Centrid (AI workspace) without ads:

A thread 🧵

1/ Started with manual outreach. Made a list of 50 people complaining about Obsidian mobile on Twitter.

DM'd them personally: "Saw your tweet, built something for this. Would you try it for $10?"

2/ 20 responded, 5 paid immediately.

Key learning: Find people in pain RIGHT NOW. They're actively looking for solutions.

[Continue thread with specific tactics, metrics, lessons]

15/ Summary:
- Manual outreach: 5 customers
- Hacker News: 8 customers
- Reddit: 12 customers
- Twitter: 3 customers

Total: $530 MRR in 8 weeks. All organic.

If you're building something, happy to share what worked!
```

**Expected Results** (By end of Week 8):

- 200-500 followers
- 5-10 signups per week from Twitter
- 2-3 paying customers from Twitter audience
- Network effects (other indie hackers sharing your journey)

#### Week 9-10: Optimize & Scale Best Channel

**Analysis** (End of Week 8):

Review data:

```
Channel | Signups | Paid Customers | Conversion % | Time Investment | Cost | ROI
HN      | 45      | 8              | 18%          | 6 hours         | $0   | ∞
PH      | 32      | 5              | 16%          | 8 hours         | $0   | ∞
Reddit  | 67      | 11             | 16%          | 12 hours        | $0   | ∞
Twitter | 23      | 4              | 17%          | 20 hours        | $0   | ∞
```

**Decision Framework**:

1. **Which channel got most PAYING customers?** (Not just signups)
2. **Which channel has best conversion rate?**
3. **Which channel can you repeat/scale?**
4. **Which channel energizes you?** (You'll do it better)

**Example: If Reddit won**:

Double down strategy:

- Post in 10 more related subreddits
- Answer questions in subreddit daily (build presence)
- Create valuable Reddit posts (not just promotion)
- Build reputation, then mention product naturally

**Example: If HN won**:

Double down strategy:

- Launch on HN monthly with "Show HN: [Product] Update - We Added [Feature]"
- Comment on relevant Ask HN threads
- Share technical blog posts on HN
- Build reputation in community

**Example: If Twitter won**:

Double down strategy:

- Tweet daily (consistency compounds)
- Engage with 20 accounts daily in your niche
- Weekly threads sharing learnings
- Build relationships with other indie hackers

### Stage 2 Success Metrics (Week 10 Checkpoint)

**Minimum Success**:

- ✅ $500 MRR (25-30 paying customers)
- ✅ Identified ONE channel that consistently brings customers
- ✅ 20%+ free trial → paid conversion rate
- ✅ <10% monthly churn

**Good Success**:

- ✅ $1,000 MRR (50-70 paying customers)
- ✅ 2 channels working consistently
- ✅ 25%+ conversion rate
- ✅ <5% monthly churn
- ✅ Customers actively using product (not just paying)

**Great Success**:

- ✅ $1,500+ MRR (75+ paying customers)
- ✅ Multiple channels working
- ✅ 30%+ conversion rate
- ✅ Customers referring others organically
- ✅ Clear product-market fit signals

**Failure Indicators**:

- ❌ <$300 MRR after 10 weeks → Need to pivot messaging or product
- ❌ No channel working consistently → Distribution problem
- ❌ High signups but low conversions → Product doesn't solve the pain
- ❌ High churn → Onboarding broken or product doesn't deliver value

---

## 🚀 STAGE 3: $1,000 → $10,000 MRR (Weeks 11-32)

**Objective**: Scale proven channels, expand to new audiences, build sustainable growth engine

**Target**: 500-550 paying customers at $19/month = $10,000 MRR

**Timeline**: ~22 weeks (5-6 months)

### The Strategy: Scale What Works + Expand Smart

**What Changes from Stage 2**:

- Move from founder-driven to systematic/automated
- Invest in content marketing (compounds over time)
- Consider paid acquisition (if unit economics work)
- Build moats: SEO, brand, community

### Month 3-4: Systematize Current Channels

**Goal**: Turn your manual efforts into repeatable systems

**If Reddit is your best channel**:

**Systematization Plan**:

1. Create content calendar (topics, subreddits, timing)
2. Batch-create 12 posts (one month of content)
3. Schedule posting (but post manually to avoid detection)
4. Template responses to common questions
5. Track performance in spreadsheet

**Scaling Plan**:

- Expand to 20+ related subreddits
- Build reputation by helping others (not just promoting)
- Create valuable content (guides, comparisons, tutorials)
- Post 3x per week instead of 1x

**Expected Impact**: 20-30 customers per month from Reddit

**If Twitter is your best channel**:

**Systematization Plan**:

1. Batch-create 30 tweets every Sunday (next week's content)
2. Schedule with Buffer/Hypefury
3. Daily engagement routine (30 min/day)
4. Weekly thread template
5. Track which content performs best

**Scaling Plan**:

- Increase posting from 5x/week to 7x/week
- Weekly threads (instead of biweekly)
- Collaborate with other indie hackers (mutual promotion)
- Build email list from Twitter followers

**Expected Impact**: 15-25 customers per month from Twitter

**If Hacker News is your best channel**:

**Systematization Plan**:

1. Monthly "Show HN" updates (share progress + new features)
2. Weekly engagement on Ask HN threads
3. Share technical blog posts
4. Build reputation in community

**Scaling Plan**:

- Can't really "scale" HN (limit on Show HN posts)
- Focus on consistent presence
- Write technical content that HN loves
- Engage authentically in comments

**Expected Impact**: 10-15 customers per month from HN (can't scale linearly)

### Month 4-5: Add Content Marketing

**Why Now**: Stage 1-2 proved product-market fit. Now invest in long-term compounding growth.

**Content Strategy: SEO-Focused Blog Posts**

**Target Keywords** (High intent, reachable):

- "Obsidian mobile alternative" (500/month, low competition)
- "AI markdown editor" (300/month, medium competition)
- "mobile markdown app" (200/month, low competition)
- "Cursor alternative for documentation" (emerging keyword)
- "AI knowledge base" (400/month, medium competition)

**Content Calendar** (2 posts per week):

**Week 1**: Comparison post

- Title: "Centrid vs Obsidian: Mobile-First AI Workspace vs Desktop-First Knowledge Base"
- Structure: Honest comparison, pros/cons of each, use cases
- CTA: "Try Centrid free for 7 days"
- Distribution: Reddit r/ObsidianMD, Twitter, HN, your email list

- Distribution: Hacker News, Dev.to, Hashnode, Twitter

**Week 4**: Practical guide

- Title: "The Complete Guide to AI-Assisted Technical Documentation"
- Structure: Step-by-step workflow, tool comparisons, best practices
- CTA: "Automate this workflow with Centrid"
- Distribution: Reddit, Medium, LinkedIn, email list

**Content Production**:

- Write yourself OR hire freelancer ($100-150/post)
- Focus on quality > quantity
- Include real examples, screenshots, data
- Optimize for SEO (headers, meta descriptions, internal links)

**Expected Timeline**: 3-6 months to see significant SEO traffic

**Expected Impact** (After 6 months):

- 500-1000 monthly organic visitors
- 20-40 signups per month from SEO
- 5-10 paying customers per month from content
- Compounding returns (grows month over month)

### Month 5-6: Evaluate Paid Acquisition

**The Decision**: Should you spend money on ads?

**Only Consider Paid Ads If**:

- ✅ LTV > $400 (customers stay >20 months)
- ✅ Conversion rate > 20% (trial to paid)
- ✅ Churn < 5% monthly
- ✅ You can afford to lose $500-1000 testing

**If Yes, Test These Channels**:

**1. Reddit Ads** (Cheapest, most targeted):

- Target subreddits: r/ObsidianMD, r/productivity, r/markdown
- Ad format: Native (looks like post)
- Budget: $10/day test ($300/month)
- Expected: $15-25 CAC if targeting is good

**2. Twitter Ads** (Good for retargeting):

- Target: Followers of Obsidian, Notion, Cursor accounts
- Ad format: Promoted tweets (not obvious ads)
- Budget: $15/day test ($450/month)
- Expected: $20-35 CAC

**3. Google Search Ads** (High intent but competitive):

- Target keywords: "obsidian alternative", "markdown editor mobile"
- Ad format: Text ads
- Budget: $20/day test ($600/month)
- Expected: $25-45 CAC (competitive)

**Testing Framework**:

- Run each channel for 30 days minimum
- Track CAC, conversion rate, LTV
- Kill if CAC > $50 or ROI < 3:1
- Double down if CAC < $25 and ROI > 5:1

**Expected Impact** (If paid ads work):

- Additional 30-50 customers per month
- $570-950 additional MRR per month
- Scales linearly with budget

## 🚨 FAILURE MODES & PIVOTS

### If You Can't Get First Customer (Week 2)

**Diagnosis**:

- Wrong audience (they don't have the pain)
- Wrong messaging (pain is real but you're communicating poorly)
- Wrong product (building features no one wants)
- Wrong price (too high or too low signals quality)

**Action Plan**:

1. Do 10 more customer conversations
2. Ask: "Would you pay $X today for this?" (not "would you use this?")
3. If no one says yes → Pivot product or target audience
4. If people say yes but don't pay → Pricing or trust issue

### If You Can't Get to $1K MRR (Week 10)

**Diagnosis**:

- Distribution problem (can't find customers at scale)
- Conversion problem (traffic but no one pays)
- Retention problem (people pay but churn quickly)

**Action Plan**:

1. Review channel data - which channels actually convert?
2. Talk to churned customers - why did they leave?
3. A/B test pricing ($15 vs $19 vs $25)
4. Simplify onboarding (too complex → people don't activate)
5. Consider: Wrong audience → Pivot to different persona

### If You Can't Get to $10K MRR (Month 8)

**Diagnosis**:

- Market too small (exhausted reachable audience)
- Competition intensified (others copied you)
- Product not sticky enough (people don't see ongoing value)

**Action Plan**:

1. Expand to adjacent markets (e.g., non-technical writers)
2. Add features that increase stickiness
3. Improve retention before scaling acquisition
4. Consider raising prices (capture more value per customer)
5. Build enterprise features (higher ACV, more stable)

## 💡 FINAL PRINCIPLES

### 1. Speed > Perfection

Launch before you're ready. Test fast, iterate faster.

### 2. Talk to Customers Relentlessly

Every customer conversation is worth 10 hours of work.

### 3. Focus Fire

One channel done extremely well > ten channels done poorly.

### 4. Follow the Energy

Do what's working. Kill what's not. Be ruthless.

### 5. Profitable from $1

Never lose money acquiring customers. Bootstrap discipline wins.

### 6. Distribution > Product

The best product doesn't win. Best distribution wins.

### 7. Consistency Compounds

Daily effort beats heroic sprints. Show up every day.
