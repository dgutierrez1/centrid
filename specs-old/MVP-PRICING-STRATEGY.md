## 🤖 AI MODEL STRATEGY

### MVP: Claude 3.5 Haiku (Single Model)

**Pricing**:

- Input: $0.80 per 1M tokens
- Output: $4.00 per 1M tokens
- **Per request**: $0.0036 (0.36 cents)

**Why This Model**:

- ✅ 8/10 quality (better than ChatGPT free tier)
- ✅ Very fast (perfect for mobile)
- ✅ 97.6% margins
- ✅ Simple implementation (single model)
- ✅ $33K cheaper than premium models in Year 1

**Request Calculation**:

```
Average request:
├─ Input: 2,000 tokens (context + prompt)
├─ Output: 500 tokens (response)
├─ Cost: $0.0036 per request
└─ Quality: Good enough to impress users
```

### Context Management

**Automatic Limits** (Critical for costs):

```
Solo Tier: Max 50K tokens context per request
Pro Tier: Max 150K tokens context per request

Implementation:
├─ Vector search finds relevant docs
├─ Send top 10-20 docs only (not entire KB)
├─ Stay under 200K token threshold
└─ Keeps costs at $0.0036/request
```

**Without limits**: A single user could cost $935/month!  
**With limits**: Predictable $0.36-$1.80/month per user

## 💾 STORAGE COSTS

### Supabase Storage Pricing

**Free Tier**: 1GB (for development)  
**Pro Tier**: $25/month base + $0.021/GB

### Per-User Storage Estimates

**Average User**:

```
50 markdown files × 50KB = 2.5MB
Vector embeddings = 0.3MB
Metadata = 0.2MB
Total: ~3MB per user
```

**Power User**:

```
200 markdown files × 50KB = 10MB
Vector embeddings = 1.2MB
Metadata = 0.8MB
Total: ~12MB per user
```

### Storage Cost Per Customer

**Solo Tier** (5GB limit):

- Average user (3MB): $0.00006/month
- Power user (5GB max): $0.10/month
- **Budget**: $0.10/month per customer

**Pro Tier** (20GB limit):

- Average user (12MB): $0.00025/month
- Power user (20GB max): $0.31/month
- **Budget**: $0.31/month per customer

**Why so cheap?** Storage is commoditized. AI costs are the real expense.

Prevents:
├─ Hitting 200K+ token pricing tier (2x cost!)
├─ Single request costing $1.87 instead of $0.0036
└─ Users bankrupting you
```

### Monitoring & Alerts

```
Set up alerts for:
├─ Users hitting 80% of limits
├─ Monthly AI costs > $100
├─ Average cost per request > $0.01
├─ Gross margin < 85%

## ⚠️ RISK MITIGATION

### What Could Go Wrong

**Risk 1: Users abuse context limits**

```
Mitigation:
├─ Hard cap at 50K/150K tokens per request
├─ Smart RAG retrieval (only relevant docs)
├─ Monitor average tokens per request
└─ Alert if > 100K tokens average
```

**Risk 2: AI costs spike**

```
Mitigation:
├─ Rate limiting (100/500 requests/month)
├─ Cost monitoring & alerts
├─ Can raise prices if needed
└─ 90%+ margin = huge buffer
```

**Risk 3: Churn is high**

```
Mitigation:
├─ 7-day trial to validate fit
├─ Usage warnings before limits
├─ Upgrade prompts (not blocks)
└─ Focus on retention features
```

**Risk 4: Model prices increase**

```
Mitigation:
├─ 90%+ margin = can absorb 5-10x price increase
├─ Can switch models if needed
├─ Can raise prices
└─ Monitor Anthropic announcements
```
