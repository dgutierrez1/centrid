# Centrid - Technical Analysis & Strategic Plan

**Version**: 2.0 (Context-First Architecture)  
**Date**: 2025-01-15  
**Status**: Strategic Blueprint

> **Core Architecture**: Multi-chat system with persistent document context via RAG + vector search. Web-first, desktop-optimized.

---

## üèóÔ∏è **System Architecture Strategy**

### **Core User Flow Analysis**

The fundamental user journey eliminates context fragmentation in AI-assisted knowledge work:

**Traditional AI Flow (ChatGPT)**: User explains context ‚Üí AI responds ‚Üí New chat ‚Üí Re-explain context ‚Üí Repeat  
**Our Context-Persistent Flow**: User uploads documents once ‚Üí Create unlimited chats ‚Üí AI always has context ‚Üí Never re-explain

This creates a **context-first architecture** where knowledge workers can branch conversations freely without losing document context.

### **System Component Strategy**

**Multi-Chat Engine**: Manages unlimited independent chat threads, each with full conversation history. Enables branching conversations without context loss.

**Persistent Context System (RAG)**: Vector database + semantic search that retrieves relevant document context automatically per message. Unlike ChatGPT, our system maintains persistent access to user's document library across all chats.

**Document Manager**: Handles upload, vector embedding generation, folder organization, and cross-device sync. Documents uploaded once are accessible across all chats forever.

**Web-First UI**: Desktop-optimized web application with three-panel layout (Documents | Chat | Chat List). Responsive for tablets/mobile as secondary priority.

---

## üìÑ **Multi-Format Text File Strategy**

### **Supported Formats Analysis**

**Core Strategy**: Support text-only formats that knowledge workers use, ensuring our AI agents can understand and work with users' existing content libraries.

**Primary Formats (MVP Launch)**:

- **Markdown (.md, .markdown)**: Our primary format - rich structure, widespread adoption
- **Plain Text (.txt)**: Universal compatibility, simplicity
- **JSON (.json)**: Configuration files, structured data
- **YAML (.yml, .yaml)**: Config files, metadata, documentation

**Secondary Formats (Month 2-3)**:

- **reStructuredText (.rst)**: Technical documentation (Python ecosystem)
- **AsciiDoc (.adoc)**: Technical writing, documentation
- **Org-mode (.org)**: Academic, research, personal knowledge management
- **TOML (.toml)**: Configuration files
- **Wiki formats (.wiki, .mediawiki)**: Collaborative documentation

### **Format Processing Strategy**

**Markdown Processing**: Extract document hierarchy (headers), identify code blocks for syntax awareness, parse links for relationship mapping, and detect tables for structured data handling.

**Structured Data Processing (JSON/YAML)**: Flatten nested objects into searchable paths, extract string values for semantic search, preserve structure metadata for context, and enable key-path querying.

**Technical Implementation Priority**:

1. **Week 1**: Markdown + Plain Text (covers 70% of use cases)
2. **Week 2**: JSON + YAML (enables configuration files)
3. **Month 2**: Remaining formats based on user feedback

## üß© **Document Chunking Strategy**

### **Why Chunking is Critical**

**Problem Analysis**: AI models have token limits but documents can be massive

- GPT-4: 128k tokens (~100 pages) but full context = expensive + slow processing
- Reality: Technical documentation easily exceeds 200-500 pages
- Solution: Break documents into searchable, contextual chunks with semantic meaning

### **MVP Chunking Strategy: Semantic Hierarchical**

**Document Chunk Requirements**:

- Unique identifier system for each chunk with document relationship tracking
- Content storage with token count monitoring (target: 400-500 tokens per chunk)
- Sequential chunk indexing within documents for navigation and context
- Hierarchical section tracking (e.g., ["Authentication", "JWT", "Setup"])
- Content type classification (text, code blocks, tables, lists) for specialized handling
- Context overlap system (50 tokens before/after for continuity)
- Semantic relationship mapping between related chunks
- Parent section reference tracking for document structure preservation

**Semantic Chunking Requirements**:

- Target chunk size: 450 tokens with maximum 600 tokens for large sections
- Intelligent section splitting based on document structure and natural boundaries
- Context overlap management (50 tokens overlap between chunks)
- Natural boundary detection (paragraph breaks, headers, code blocks, tables)
- Fallback splitting strategies when natural boundaries exceed size limits
- Section hierarchy preservation throughout chunking process
- Related chunk identification and cross-referencing

**Chunking Quality Requirements**:

- Average chunk size monitoring and optimization
- Chunk size variance analysis for consistency
- Context preservation scoring to maintain semantic meaning
- Boundary respect analysis to measure natural splitting success
- Overlap efficiency measurement for context continuity
- Quality metrics dashboard for continuous improvement
- Automated quality assessment and adjustment algorithms

**Concept**: Convert text into numerical arrays that represent semantic meaning

- Example: "JWT token configuration" becomes array of 1536 numbers representing meaning
- Similar concepts produce similar numerical patterns for semantic matching
- Enables AI to understand content relationships beyond keyword matching

**Why Essential**: Enables semantic search - find content by meaning, not just keywords

### **MVP Embedding Requirements**

- Unique constraints to prevent duplicate embeddings per chunk

**Vector Index Requirements**:

- HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) indexing for fast similarity search
- Cosine similarity operator optimization for semantic matching
- Index configuration (m=16, ef_construction=64) for balance of speed/accuracy
- Metadata indexing on chunk_id and created_at for efficient queries
- Query performance optimization targeting sub-500ms response times

**Search Engine Requirements**:

- Configurable similarity threshold (default 0.7) for relevance filtering
- Result limiting and pagination support (default 10 results)
- Document and content type filtering capabilities
- User-scoped search ensuring data privacy and security
- Similarity scoring with confidence intervals
- Search result ranking based on cosine similarity distances

**Hybrid Search Requirements**:
