## Strategic Foundation

### Terminology & Positioning Consistency

**Core Pattern**: Use "knowledge work" for market/audience, "context" for technical benefit

| Situation             | Use This                  | Avoid                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Describing audience   | "Knowledge workers"       | "Content creators", "Users"            |
| Describing market     | "Knowledge work"          | "Content creation", "Productivity"     |
| Describing problem    | "Context fragmentation"   | "Knowledge loss", "Starting over"      |
| Describing solution   | "Persistent context"      | "Remembers everything", "Never forget" |
| Describing benefit    | "Better knowledge work"   | "Better content", "More productive"    |
| Describing feature    | "Document context access" | "Knowledge base", "Memory"             |
| Describing pain point | "Re-explaining context"   | "Re-explaining knowledge"              |

**Why This Works**:

- "Knowledge work" = Accessible market framing (who it's for)
- "Context" = Precise technical benefit (what we do differently)
- Together = Unique positioning that's both broad and specific

---

### Target Audience (Primary)

**Knowledge Workers & Power Users** - Priority 1

**Pain Points**:

- Re-explaining context to AI in every new conversation
- Losing context when switching between topics or projects
- Managing multiple AI threads about related things
- Digging through old documents and past conversations
- Starting from scratch even for similar work
- Context fragmentation across different chats

**Desired Outcome**:

- Work with AI that already knows their documents
- Switch topics without re-explaining context
- Research, create, analyze with persistent knowledge
- Branch conversations without losing parent context

**Language They Use**:

- "Why do I have to explain this to ChatGPT again?"
- "I wish the AI just remembered my documents"
- "I need to explore this subtopic but don't want to lose my main thread"
- "Where did I put that research?"
- "Can AI maintain context as I switch between projects?"

---

### Core Value Proposition

**What**: AI for knowledge work with persistent document context

**How**: Upload documents → AI maintains context → Work across multiple chats with shared document access

**MVP Reality**: Multiple chats access the same uploaded documents, reducing re-uploading and re-explaining context

**Emotional Benefit**: Focus on knowledge work, not context management. Your AI maintains access to your documents as you switch topics, branch discussions, and explore ideas.

### Problem Agitation Section

**Headline**:

```
Context Fragmentation Is Killing Your Productivity
```

**Body**:

```
When working with AI, you constantly:

❌ Re-explain the same context in different conversations
❌ Copy-paste documents repeatedly to maintain context
❌ Lose your train of thought when exploring tangents
❌ Manage disconnected threads about related work
❌ Spend more time on context setup than actual knowledge work

The result? Fragmented thinking. Lost productivity. Exhaustion.
```

**Empathy Statement**:

```
This is the hidden cost of context fragmentation: 12+ hours a week
spent re-explaining, searching, and reconstructing context.

There's a better way to work with AI.
```

### Trust & Credibility Section

**Option 2: Technology & Security** (Use both)

```
Built on Trusted Technology

🔒 Your documents are encrypted at rest and in transit
🤖 Powered by Claude AI (Anthropic)
🏗️ Infrastructure by Supabase (enterprise-grade)
🌍 Hosted on Vercel (SOC 2 compliant)

Your documents are yours. We never train AI models on your data.
Your content stays completely private.
```

### FAQ Section

**Headline**:

```
Questions? We've Got Answers.
```

**Q: Is my data secure?**

```
Absolutely. Your documents are encrypted and stored securely.
We never share your data or use it to train AI models. You own your content.
```

**Q: How is this different from ChatGPT?**

```
ChatGPT doesn't maintain document context across conversations—you have
to re-upload or copy-paste context each time. Centrid provides shared
document access across multiple chats.

It's designed to reduce the constant context re-explanation that happens
with traditional AI chat interfaces.
```

**Q: What if I don't have many documents?**

```
No problem! Start with 3-5 documents (even notes or drafts).
Centrid works with whatever you have and gets smarter as you add more.
```

**Q: Do I need to learn prompt engineering?**

```
Nope. Just talk naturally: "Create a blog post about X" or
"Make this better." The AI is designed to understand intent conversationally.
```

**Q: What happens after my trial?**

```
You can upgrade to a paid plan ($25/month) or cancel anytime.
No credit card required to start, so there's zero risk.
```

**Q: Which AI model do you use?**

```
We use Claude (by Anthropic)—one of the most advanced and
capable AI models available. It excels at understanding context
and maintaining consistency across documents.
```

**Q: Do my chats share context with each other?**

```
Multiple chats access the same uploaded documents, providing shared
document context. Chat history awareness (one chat referencing another
chat's conversation) is planned for a future update.
```

## Core Conversion Principles

### The 3-Second Rule

User must be able to answer within 3 seconds:

1. **What does this do?** → "AI for knowledge work with persistent document context"
2. **Who is it for?** → "Knowledge workers tired of context fragmentation"
3. **What's next?** → "Start free trial, upload documents"

**Test**: Show page to someone unfamiliar. If they can't answer all three → revise

### Single, Clear CTA

**Rules**:

1. ONE primary action: "Get Started Free"
2. Same CTA repeated 4-5 times down page
3. Always use action verbs (Get, Start, Create)
4. Never use weak CTAs (Submit, Continue, Learn More)

**CTA Button**:

- **Color**: High contrast (test purple vs. green)
- **Size**: Minimum 48px height
- **Text**: Specific + benefit ("Get Started Free")
- **Subtext**: Address objection ("No credit card required")

**Placement**:

1. Hero section
2. After problem section
3. After solution
4. After use cases
5. Final section

### Benefit-Focused Copy

For every feature, ask: **"So what?"**

| Feature                         | Benefit (The "So What?")                                                                           |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "AI learns from your documents" | "Stop explaining your business every time. Create faster with AI that already knows your context." |
| "Three specialized workflows"   | "The right approach for every task—create, improve, or research with purpose-built flows."         |
| "Encrypted storage"             | "Sleep well. Your competitive intel stays secure—we never peek or train on your content."          |

**Focus on emotional benefits**:

- Confidence ("Create without second-guessing")
- Relief ("Stop wasting hours searching")
- Freedom ("Focus on strategy, not repetition")

### Distraction Removal

**Remove**:

- ❌ Navigation menu
- ❌ Social media icons in header
- ❌ Outbound links
- ❌ Multiple different CTAs
- ❌ Newsletter signup
- ❌ Chat widget (add later)

**Keep Only**:

- ✅ One CTA (repeated)
- ✅ Small legal footer
- ✅ Scroll indicators

### Key Metrics

**Funnel**:

1. Landing page visitors → 100%
2. Signup started → Target 15%
3. Signup completed → Target 10%
4. Documents uploaded → Target 40% of signups
5. Content created → Target 60% of activated users

**Behavior**:

- Time on page: Target 2+ minutes
- Scroll depth: Target 75%+ reach bottom
- Bounce rate: Target <40%
- CTA click rate: Target 15%+

### Launch Goals (First 30 Days)

- **Traffic**: 1,000 visitors
- **Signups**: 50-100 (5-10% conversion)
- **Activated**: 20-40 (40% activation rate)
- **Paying**: 4-12 (20-30% trial-to-paid)

**Red Flags**:

- Bounce rate >60% → Headline/clarity issue
