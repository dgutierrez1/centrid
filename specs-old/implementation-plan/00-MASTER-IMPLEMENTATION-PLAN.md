## 🎯 **IMPLEMENTATION OVERVIEW**

### **Core Innovation Delivery**

We're building **Centrid** - a mobile-first AI agent workspace for content creation. "Cursor for Content" with knowledge base context and mobile-responsive functionality.

**Simplified MVP Architecture**: Supabase + Vercel stack with Claude Sonnet for all AI operations, PostgreSQL full-text search (no vector embeddings), Mercado Pago billing for Colombian market, real-time updates via WebSocket/SSE.

### **Critical Path Dependencies (Simplified with Supabase)**

**Traditional Approach (20+ weeks):**
Backend → Database → Auth → Real-time → AI System → Frontend → Mobile

**Supabase Plus Approach (4 weeks to MVP):**
Supabase + Core Libraries → AI Edge Functions → Frontend Integration → Scale-Ready Architecture

### **Success Metrics (MVP Timeline)**

- **Week 4-5**: MVP launched, first 20-50 users testing
- **Post-MVP**: Gather feedback and prioritize features from POST-MVP-FEATURES.md based on user demand
