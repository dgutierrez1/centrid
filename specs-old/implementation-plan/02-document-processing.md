# Document Processing - Feature Definition (MVP)

**Version**: 3.0 (PRD - No Implementation Details)
**Date**: 2025-01-15
**Status**: Ready for Planning
**Priority**: Critical Path - Required for AI agents
**Dependencies**: Backend Architecture

---

## 🎯 OVERVIEW

### Objective

Build a document processing pipeline that converts user files (.md, .txt, .pdf) into searchable, AI-ready knowledge base using PostgreSQL full-text search.

### Success Criteria

- Support markdown, txt, and PDF files up to 10MB
- Use PostgreSQL full-text search (NO vector embeddings for MVP)
- Process documents in <60 seconds (50-page documents)
- Maintain >95% processing success rate
- Enable <1-second text search responses
- **Cost Target**: $0 for search indexing

## 📐 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### Processing Pipeline

```
File Upload → Format Detection → Text Extraction → Content Analysis → Full-Text Indexing → PostgreSQL Storage
```

### Core Components

1. **File Processor** - Multi-format text extraction with metadata
2. **Content Analyzer** - Quality validation and structure detection
3. **Text Chunker** - Break content into searchable segments
4. **Full-Text Indexer** - PostgreSQL tsvector generation
5. **Background Queue** - Async processing with progress tracking

## 📋 FEATURE REQUIREMENTS

### 1. File Processing

**Supported Formats:**
- Markdown (.md)
- Plain text (.txt)
- PDF (.pdf)

**Extraction Requirements:**
- Detect and handle encoding (UTF-8, Latin-1, etc.)
- Extract document structure (headers, sections, code blocks)
- Preserve metadata (title, author, creation date)
- Handle malformed/corrupted files gracefully
- Support incremental processing for large files

**Quality Standards:**
- Minimum 100 characters of meaningful text
- Detect and skip duplicate content
- Identify document language
- Validate structure integrity

### 2. Content Analysis

**Analysis Metrics:**
- Word count and reading time
- Language detection
- Content type (text, code, tables, lists)
- Document complexity
- Quality score

**Validation Rules:**
- Reject empty documents
- Warn on low-quality content
- Flag duplicate sections
- Check heading hierarchy

### 3. Text Chunking

**Chunking Strategy:**
- Target chunk size: 400-500 tokens
- Respect natural boundaries (paragraphs, sections)
- Maintain context with overlapping chunks
- Preserve document structure in metadata

**Special Handling:**
- **Code blocks**: Keep functions/classes intact
- **Tables**: Maintain headers and structure
- **Lists**: Preserve hierarchy and numbering

**Chunk Metadata:**
- Document ID and section hierarchy
- Content type (text/code/table/list)
- Position in document
- Language and keywords

### 4. Background Processing

**Queue System:**
- Async processing with job queue
- Real-time progress updates (0% → 100%)
- Retry failed jobs (3 attempts, exponential backoff)
- Priority queuing for premium users
- Dead letter queue for manual review

**Status Tracking:**
- `pending` - Queued for processing
- `processing` - Extraction in progress
- `completed` - Ready for search
- `error` - Failed with error message

### 5. Full-Text Search

**Search Features:**
- PostgreSQL `tsvector` with GIN indexes
- Ranked results by relevance
- Keyword highlighting
- Filter by document/user
- Fast queries (<1 second)

**Search Optimization:**
- Auto-generated search vectors
- Weighted ranking (title > headers > body)
- Stop word removal
- Stemming support

## 🎯 USER EXPERIENCE

### Upload Flow

1. User drags/drops file or selects from file picker
2. Client validates file size/type
3. File uploads to Supabase Storage
4. Processing job created, user sees progress
5. Real-time updates show extraction progress
6. Completion notification with document summary

### Search Flow

1. User enters search query
2. Full-text search across user's documents
3. Results ranked by relevance
4. Click result to view document with highlights
5. Optionally filter by document/date

## 📊 SUCCESS METRICS

**Processing:**
- Average processing time
- Success/failure rates
- Error types and frequency
- Queue depth and throughput

**Search:**

## 🔄 DEFERRED POST-MVP

**Not included in initial MVP:**
- Vector embeddings and semantic search
- Redis caching layer
- JSON/YAML structured data support
- Advanced quality scoring
- Multi-language support beyond detection
- Document versioning
- Collaborative editing

**Rationale:** Focus on core full-text search functionality first. Add semantic search when proven necessary.
