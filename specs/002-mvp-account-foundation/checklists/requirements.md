## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria

## Validation Results

### ✅ Passing Items (13/14)

1. **Content Quality** - PASS
   - No code snippets or technical implementation details
   - Focused on user needs (signup, login, data isolation)
   - Accessible language throughout

2. **Requirements Testability** - PASS
   - All FRs are verifiable (e.g., "System MUST validate email addresses")
   - Each has clear yes/no pass criteria

3. **Success Criteria Quality** - PASS
   - All SCs are measurable: "under 60 seconds", "100% of the time", "100 concurrent requests"
   - All are technology-agnostic (no mention of Supabase, databases, etc.)

4. **Acceptance Scenarios** - PASS
   - All user stories have Given/When/Then scenarios
   - Cover happy path and error cases

5. **Edge Cases** - PASS
   - Identified 5 critical edge cases
   - Most are resolved except password reset (marked for clarification)

6. **Scope Boundaries** - PASS
   - "Out of Scope" section explicitly lists deferred features
   - Clear what's NOT included in MVP

7. **Dependencies** - PASS
   - Database schema, auth service, storage identified

8. **Assumptions** - PASS
   - Clear assumptions about email confirmation, password requirements, etc.

### ⚠️  Needs Attention (1/14)

1. **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION] Markers** - PARTIAL PASS
   - **Issue**: 1 clarification marker remains (Edge Cases: "What happens when password is forgotten?")
   - **Location**: spec.md:66
   - **Question**: Should password reset be included in MVP or deferred?

## Clarification Required

Before proceeding to planning, resolve the following clarification:

### Question 1: Password Reset Scope

**Context**: Edge case handling for forgotten passwords

**What we need to know**: Should password reset functionality be included in the MVP release, or can it be deferred to post-MVP?

**Suggested Answers**:

| Option   | Answer                                                                                               | Implications                                                                                                                           |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A        | Defer password reset to post-MVP                                                                     | Simplifies MVP implementation. Users who forget passwords must contact support. Acceptable for small test user base.                   |
| B        | Include basic email-based password reset in MVP                                                      | Adds 2-3 hours to implementation. Better UX, reduces support burden. Recommended if expecting >10 test users.                          |
| C        | Include basic password reset but without email (admin-initiated only)                               | Moderate complexity. Admins can manually reset passwords. Good middle ground for testing phase.                                        |
| Custom   | Provide your own answer                                                                              | Please specify your preferred approach and reasoning.                                                                                  |

**Recommendation**: Option A (defer) is best for MVP since the spec explicitly states "small test user base" in Assumptions. Can add before broader launch.

## Notes

- Spec is very well-structured with clear MVP focus
- Good use of "Out of Scope" section to manage expectations
- Success criteria are properly measurable and technology-agnostic
- Only blocker is the single clarification question - once resolved, ready for planning
