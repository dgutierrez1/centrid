# Tasks: MVP Account Foundation

**Feature Branch**: `002-mvp-account-foundation`
**Status**: ‚úÖ **FEATURE COMPLETE - Ready for PR**
**Date**: 2025-01-22

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-mvp-account-foundation/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

**Tests**: Manual testing only for MVP (automated tests deferred post-MVP per plan.md)

---

## üéâ Implementation Complete

All 124 tasks have been completed successfully:
- **Implementation**: 83 code tasks ‚úÖ
- **Manual Testing**: 41 testing tasks ‚úÖ
- **Deployment**: Database schema + 3 Edge Functions ‚úÖ
- **Success Criteria**: All 10 criteria met ‚úÖ

**What's Deployed**:
- Database schema with CASCADE DELETE foreign keys & RLS policies
- 3 Edge Functions: create-account, update-profile, delete-account
- 8 frontend pages: signup, login, forgot-password, reset-password, auth/callback, dashboard, profile, account/delete
- Shared libraries: validation schemas, Supabase clients, auth utilities

**Next Action**: Create pull request to merge into main branch

## Format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

---

## Phase 8: Password Reset Flow

**Goal**: Users can request password reset via email and set new password using secure, time-limited link

**Independent Test**: User receives reset email, clicks link, sets new password, automatically logged in

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 stories ‚Üí P2 stories ‚Üí Password Reset)
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all user stories being complete
- **Testing (Phase 10)**: Depends on all implementation phases

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies (login is independent)
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Depends on US1 and US2 (needs signup/login to test protected routes)
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Requires auth but independent feature
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Requires auth but independent feature
- **Password Reset**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of user stories

### Within Each User Story

- Backend Edge Functions before Frontend pages (need API to call)
- Validation schemas before implementation (shared dependency)
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: T001, T002, T003, T004 can all run in parallel

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**: T007+T008+T009+T010 can run in parallel after T005+T006 complete

**Phase 3 (US1)**: T013 (backend) and T018 (frontend) can start in parallel after foundational

**Phase 4 (US2)**: T023-T029 can all start after foundational (independent from US1)

**Phase 5 (US3)**: T030+T031 can run in parallel

**Phase 6 (US4)**: T037 (backend) and T043 (frontend) can start in parallel

**Phase 7 (US5)**: T050 (backend) and T056 (frontend) can start in parallel

**Phase 8 (Password Reset)**: T063+T068 can run in parallel

**Phase 9 (Polish)**: T074, T075, T079, T080, T081 can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Account Creation)

```bash
# Backend and Frontend can start in parallel:
Task T013: "Create Edge Function create-account/index.ts"
Task T018: "Create signup page page.tsx"

# Then sequential within each track:
Backend: T013 ‚Üí T014 ‚Üí T015 ‚Üí T016 ‚Üí T017
Frontend: T018 ‚Üí T019 ‚Üí T020 ‚Üí T021 ‚Üí T022
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1-3 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Signup)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Login)
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (Protected Access)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test P1 stories independently
7. Deploy/demo if ready (MVP complete!)

### Incremental Delivery (Full Feature)

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Stories 1-3 (P1) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 4 (Profile Edit) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy
4. Add User Story 5 (Account Delete) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy
5. Add Password Reset ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy
6. Add Polish ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy (Full feature!)

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (Phases 1-2)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 + 2 (signup + login)
   - Developer B: User Story 3 + 4 (protected access + profile edit)
   - Developer C: User Story 5 + Password Reset
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

**Format Validation**: ‚úÖ All tasks follow checklist format (checkbox, ID, optional [P] and [Story] labels, file paths)

---

## Notes

- All tasks follow strict checklist format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- Manual testing only for MVP (automated tests deferred post-MVP)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Tests are in Phase 10 to match quickstart.md validation approach
