# Feature Specification: MVP Account Foundation

**Feature Branch**: `002-mvp-account-foundation`
**Created**: 2025-01-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "implement minimal account foundation for MVP - cut scope to essentials only user signup login and profile creation"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-21

- Q: Should password reset functionality be included in this MVP implementation or completely deferred? → A: Include basic email-based password reset flow (adds 2-3 hours implementation time but better UX)
- Q: What should the user session timeout duration be? → A: 7 days (balanced approach, industry standard for web apps)
- Q: How should the system handle authentication service failures? → A: Show error, allow retry, display service status (balanced UX with implementation simplicity)
- Q: How should account creation be architected to ensure security and prevent data corruption? → A: Server-side Edge Function with transaction-like rollback (validates input, creates auth + profile atomically, rolls back on failure)
- Q: Should basic profile modification and account deletion be included in MVP? → A: Yes, include basic name modification and full account deletion (user autonomy and GDPR compliance)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - New User Account Creation (Priority: P1)

A new user visits the application and needs to create an account to access features.

**Why this priority**: Account creation is the absolute foundation - without it, no other features can work. This is the critical path blocker for document processing.

**Independent Test**: User can complete the full signup flow independently - enters email/password, submits form, and gains authenticated access to the application. Success means user sees a personalized dashboard.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is on the signup page, **When** they enter a valid email and password, **Then** server validates input, creates both auth account and profile atomically, and user is automatically logged in
2. **Given** a user is on the signup page, **When** they enter an invalid email format, **Then** server-side validation rejects the request and they see an error message explaining the email format requirements
3. **Given** a user is on the signup page, **When** they enter a password that's too short, **Then** server-side validation rejects the request and they see an error message explaining password requirements
4. **Given** a user creates an account, **When** signup completes, **Then** a user profile is automatically created with default settings (free plan, zero usage) in atomic operation with auth account
5. **Given** profile creation fails after auth account created, **When** the error is detected, **Then** server automatically rolls back the auth account and user sees error message to retry

### User Story 2 - Returning User Login (Priority: P1)

An existing user needs to log back into their account after signing up previously.

**Why this priority**: Users must be able to return to the application. Without login, every session would require creating a new account. This is P1 because it's part of the minimal account foundation.

**Independent Test**: User with existing credentials can log in and access their personalized content. Success means user sees their dashboard with their data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has an existing account, **When** they enter correct email and password on login page, **Then** they are logged in and redirected to their dashboard
2. **Given** a user attempts to log in, **When** they enter an incorrect password, **Then** they see an error message without revealing whether the email exists
3. **Given** a user attempts to log in, **When** they enter an unregistered email, **Then** they see the same generic error as incorrect password
4. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they refresh the page, **Then** they remain logged in

---

### User Story 3 - Accessing Protected Content (Priority: P1)

Users should only be able to access application features when authenticated, and should only see their own data.

**Why this priority**: Data isolation is a security fundamental that must be in place from day 1. Without it, document processing cannot safely launch.

**Independent Test**: Unauthenticated users are redirected to login when trying to access protected pages. Authenticated users only see their own data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is not logged in, **When** they try to access a protected page (e.g., dashboard), **Then** they are redirected to the login page
2. **Given** a user is logged in, **When** they navigate to protected pages, **Then** they can access those pages
3. **Given** multiple users exist in the system, **When** user A is logged in, **Then** user A can only view/modify their own data, not user B's data

---

### User Story 4 - Profile Modification (Priority: P2)

An authenticated user needs to update their display name in their profile.

**Why this priority**: Users should be able to personalize their account. P2 because it's not required for basic functionality but enhances user experience and autonomy.

**Independent Test**: User can update their name and see the change reflected immediately. Success means updated name displays in dashboard and persists across sessions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a logged-in user is on their profile page, **When** they update their display name and save, **Then** the name is updated in the database and displayed immediately
2. **Given** a logged-in user updates their name, **When** they refresh the page, **Then** the updated name persists
3. **Given** a logged-in user enters an invalid name (e.g., only whitespace), **When** they try to save, **Then** server-side validation rejects it with clear error message

---

### User Story 5 - Account Deletion (Priority: P2)

A user needs to permanently delete their account and all associated data.

**Why this priority**: User autonomy and GDPR compliance requirement. P2 because it's legally important but not required for core functionality.

**Independent Test**: User can delete their account through a secure confirmation flow. Success means account, profile, and all user data are permanently removed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a logged-in user requests account deletion, **When** they confirm deletion (e.g., type "DELETE" or re-enter password), **Then** their account, profile, documents, and all associated data are permanently deleted
2. **Given** a user deletes their account, **When** deletion completes, **Then** they are logged out and redirected to a confirmation page
3. **Given** a user's account is deleted, **When** they try to log in with old credentials, **Then** system shows "account not found" error
4. **Given** a user initiates deletion but doesn't confirm, **When** they cancel or close the dialog, **Then** no deletion occurs and account remains active

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to sign up with an email that already exists? → System shows error: "An account with this email already exists"
- How does the system handle network failures during signup/login? → User sees error message, can retry, no partial account created
- What happens if profile auto-creation fails after user signup? → Server-side function rolls back authentication account, user sees error, can retry - ensures no orphaned auth accounts exist
- What happens if someone tries to bypass frontend and create accounts directly? → Server-side validation prevents unauthorized account creation, all requests must go through validated Edge Function
- What happens when a user's session expires while using the app? → User is redirected to login page, can log back in and continue
- What happens when password is forgotten? → User can request password reset via email, receives secure reset link, sets new password
- What happens when authentication service is temporarily unavailable? → User sees clear error message ("Service temporarily unavailable, please try again"), retry button available, no data corruption
- What happens when a user updates their name to something invalid (empty, too long, special characters only)? → Server-side validation rejects it with specific error message
- What happens to a user's documents, agent requests, and usage data when they delete their account? → All data is permanently deleted via cascade delete to ensure complete removal (GDPR compliance)
- What happens if a user accidentally initiates account deletion? → Multi-step confirmation process (re-authentication or typing "DELETE") prevents accidental deletion

### UI/UX Requirements

#### Screens/Views Needed

- **Signup Page**: New users create accounts by providing email and password
- **Login Page**: Returning users authenticate with email and password
- **Forgot Password Page**: Users request password reset by entering their email
- **Reset Password Page**: Users set new password using secure link from email
- **Dashboard Page** (Protected): Landing page after successful authentication showing welcome message and user email
- **Profile Settings Page** (Protected): Users view and edit their display name
- **Account Deletion Page** (Protected): Users initiate account deletion with confirmation flow

#### Key Interactive Elements

- **Signup Form**: Email input, password input, submit button - States: empty, typing, validating, submitting, error
- **Login Form**: Email input, password input, submit button - States: empty, typing, submitting, error
- **Forgot Password Form**: Email input, submit button - States: empty, typing, submitting, success (confirmation message), error
- **Reset Password Form**: New password input, confirm password input, submit button - States: empty, typing, validating, submitting, error

- **Account Deletion Confirmation**: Warning message, confirmation input (type "DELETE" or password), delete button, cancel button - States: initial warning, confirming, processing, error
- **Logout Action**: Button or link to end user session
- **Navigation Links**: Link from signup to login page, link from login to signup page, link from login to forgot password page, link from dashboard to profile settings

#### Responsive Requirements

- **Mobile Priority**: Forms must be easy to complete on mobile devices with large touch targets and minimal scrolling
- **Desktop Enhancements**: Forms centered on page with appropriate width constraints for readability

#### Critical States

- **Loading**: Form shows loading indicator and disables submit button during authentication
- **Error**: Clear error messages displayed near relevant form fields explaining what went wrong and how to fix it (includes service unavailability errors with retry option)
- **Service Unavailable**: Dedicated error state showing "Service temporarily unavailable" with visible retry button
- **Success**: After successful signup/login, immediate redirect to dashboard (no confirmation page needed for MVP)
- **Empty**: Login/signup pages show clean, minimal forms with clear call-to-action
- **Profile Update Success**: Immediate visual feedback showing name updated, new name displayed across UI
- **Deletion Warning**: Prominent, unmistakable warning about permanent data loss before user confirms deletion
- **Deletion Confirmation**: Clear feedback that deletion is in progress, then redirect to public page with confirmation message

#### Accessibility Priorities

- **Keyboard Navigation**: All forms fully navigable with tab key, can submit with enter key
- **Screen Reader**: Form inputs have clear labels, errors announced when they occur
- **Touch Targets**: Buttons and input fields minimum 44x44px tap targets on mobile

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: New users can complete account creation in under 60 seconds
- **SC-002**: Account creation is atomic - zero orphaned auth accounts exist (100% rollback success on profile failure)
- **SC-003**: All account creation attempts are validated server-side (zero frontend bypass attempts succeed)
- **SC-004**: Existing users can log in in under 30 seconds
- **SC-005**: User sessions persist correctly across page refreshes 100% of the time
- **SC-006**: Zero cases of users accessing another user's data (perfect data isolation)
- **SC-007**: Authentication system supports 100 concurrent signup/login requests without degradation
- **SC-008**: Profile name updates reflect immediately across UI (under 1 second visible update)
- **SC-009**: Account deletion removes 100% of user data with zero orphaned records (complete cascade delete)
- **SC-010**: Zero accidental deletions occur (confirmation process prevents all unintended deletions)

## Dependencies

- **Database Schema**: User profiles, documents, and related tables must be deployed before this feature can be tested
- **Authentication Service**: Supabase Auth must be configured and operational
- **Storage**: Database must be accessible and writable

## Assumptions

- Email/password authentication is sufficient for MVP (social OAuth deferred)
- Email confirmation is NOT required for MVP (users can authenticate immediately)
- Basic email-based password reset is included in MVP (adds 2-3 hours to implementation)
- Account creation will use server-side Edge Function architecture for security and atomicity
- Basic profile editing included in MVP (display name only, not password or email changes)
- Account deletion included for GDPR compliance and user autonomy
- Cascade delete will handle all related data (documents, agent requests, usage events)
- Minimum password length of 6 characters is acceptable (industry standard: 8+, but 6 is acceptable for MVP)
- User sessions will expire after 7 days of inactivity (balanced security and UX)
- Password reset links will expire after 1 hour (security best practice)
- Usage tracking infrastructure will be in place but limits will not be enforced in MVP

## Out of Scope

The following features are explicitly excluded from this MVP release:

- Social authentication (Google, Apple, GitHub, Microsoft OAuth)
- Email verification/confirmation
- Advanced profile editing (email change, password change via settings page, preferences, advanced settings)
- Usage limit enforcement (tracking exists but no hard blocks)
- Billing or payment integration
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Remember me / extended sessions
- Account linking (merging multiple auth methods)
- Data export before deletion (user must manually save their data)

## Notes

- **Why no email confirmation?**: Reduces friction for MVP testing. Can be enabled later for production.
- **Why no social OAuth?**: Simplifies implementation. Email/password sufficient for early users.
- **Why include password reset?**: Improves UX and reduces support burden. Worth the 2-3 hour implementation cost for better user experience.
- **Why data isolation from day 1?**: Security basics cannot be retrofitted safely. Easier to build correctly from the start.
- **Why server-side account creation?**: Prevents frontend injection attacks, ensures atomic operations (both auth and profile succeed or fail together), maintains data integrity, and provides single point of validation control.
- **Why include profile editing?**: User autonomy and personalization. Basic name editing adds minimal complexity while significantly improving UX.
- **Why include account deletion?**: GDPR compliance requirement and user rights. Must be available from day 1 for any production system handling user data.
