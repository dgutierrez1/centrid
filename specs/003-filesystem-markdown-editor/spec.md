# Feature Specification: File System & Markdown Editor with AI Context Management

**Feature Branch**: `003-filesystem-markdown-editor`
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "we need to implement next feature for the file processing and filesystem setup and management. we will target a bigger scope, we need the full file system setup. so users need to be able to CRUD their file system and files. the ui needs to be setup so we can build on top of it later, even though we are only focusing on the filesystem. the ui for desktop will have three panels, on the left we have the file system with tree view, on the center we have the document currently opened (maybe none are opned), on the right we have the ai chat. for mobile is trickier, the main focus screen could either be a chat or a document, the user will be able to change between one another when they select a chat or a document. the files would be ideally in markdown so they can be render correctly and good looking in the UI, users should be able to edit the files in the ui with styling and editing tools. can we implement automatic saving and updates to prevent users to have to manually save the files and loose data potentially. the visualization tool we use on the ui should allow later on to integrate diffs from the ai agent changes/suggestions, so keep in mind the ui tool will need to be extended in the future. we also need to setup things to work with the ai agents for search, optimal context, indexing, etc, so we need to focus on the core problem we want to adress about context fragmentation and enabling agents to do context optimal worflows."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Create and Edit Markdown Documents (Priority: P1)

A user logs in to Centrid and wants to create a new document to organize their thoughts or project notes. They create a new markdown file, write content with rich text formatting, and the system automatically saves their work without manual intervention.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability of the entire feature. Without the ability to create and edit documents, no other functionality can exist. This delivers immediate value by giving users a place to store and edit their knowledge.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a new user account, creating a markdown file, typing content with formatting, closing the browser, and reopening to verify content persists. Delivers a complete note-taking experience.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user viewing the application, **When** they click "New Document", **Then** a new untitled markdown file is created in their root directory and opened in the editor
2. **Given** a user editing a markdown document, **When** they type text and apply formatting (bold, italic, headers, lists), **Then** the markdown syntax is correctly applied and rendered in real-time
3. **Given** a user has been typing for 3 seconds without new input, **When** the auto-save timer triggers, **Then** their content is persisted to the backend without any visible save action required
4. **Given** a user has unsaved changes and closes the browser, **When** they return and open the same document, **Then** all their changes are preserved

### User Story 2 - Navigate Hierarchical File Structure (Priority: P1)

A user has multiple documents and wants to organize them into folders. They create folders, move files between folders, rename items, and navigate through their file tree to find the document they need.

**Why this priority**: Organization is critical for scaling beyond a few documents. This enables users to build a structured knowledge base rather than a flat list of files. Essential for the "context management" core value proposition.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating multiple folders and documents, organizing them into a hierarchy, renaming items, moving files between folders, and verifying the tree structure updates correctly. Delivers a complete file organization experience.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user viewing the file tree, **When** they right-click on a folder or root and select "New Folder", **Then** a new folder is created with a default name ready to be renamed
2. **Given** a user with multiple documents, **When** they drag a document from one folder to another in the tree view, **Then** the document moves to the new location and the tree updates immediately
3. **Given** a user viewing the file tree, **When** they click on a document name, **Then** the document opens in the center editor panel and is marked as the active document
4. **Given** a user right-clicks on a file or folder, **When** they select "Delete", **Then** a confirmation dialog appears, and upon confirmation, the item is removed from the tree and backend
5. **Given** a user right-clicks on a file or folder, **When** they select "Rename" and type a new name, **Then** the item is renamed both in the UI and backend

### User Story 3 - Three-Panel Desktop Workspace (Priority: P1)

A user working on a desktop computer sees a three-panel layout: file tree on the left, document editor in the center, and AI chat on the right. This layout provides immediate access to all core features without requiring navigation between screens.

**Why this priority**: The three-panel layout is the core UX paradigm that enables the AI-enhanced workflow. It allows users to reference their files while chatting with AI, creating a seamless context-aware experience. This is the visual foundation for all future AI features.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the application on a desktop browser, verifying all three panels are visible, resizing panels, and confirming each panel functions independently. Delivers the complete workspace foundation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user opens the application on a desktop browser (width > 1024px), **When** the app loads, **Then** three panels are visible: file tree (left, 20% width), editor (center, 50% width), chat (right, 30% width)
2. **Given** a user viewing the three-panel layout, **When** they drag the divider between panels, **Then** panels resize fluidly with minimum width constraints to prevent collapse
3. **Given** a user with a document open in the center panel, **When** they type in the AI chat on the right, **Then** both panels remain visible and functional simultaneously
4. **Given** a user with no document selected, **When** they view the center panel, **Then** they see an empty state with prompts to create or open a document

### User Story 4 - Mobile Adaptive Interface (Priority: P2)

A user accessing the application on a mobile device sees a focused single-panel view. They can toggle between viewing their current document and the AI chat, with the file tree accessible via a slide-out menu.

**Why this priority**: Mobile support is important for accessibility and modern user expectations, but can be delivered after the core desktop experience. This allows us to validate the core features on desktop first, then adapt the interface patterns.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the application on a mobile browser or device, navigating between document and chat views, accessing the file tree menu, and performing basic file operations. Delivers a complete mobile experience.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user opens the application on a mobile device (width < 768px), **When** the app loads, **Then** only one primary panel is visible at a time (either document or chat)
2. **Given** a user viewing a document on mobile, **When** they tap the "Chat" toggle button, **Then** the view transitions to the AI chat panel with the document context preserved
3. **Given** a user on mobile, **When** they tap the menu icon, **Then** the file tree slides out as an overlay and can be dismissed by tapping outside or selecting a file
4. **Given** a user viewing the file tree overlay on mobile, **When** they tap a document, **Then** the overlay closes and the selected document opens in the main view

### User Story 5 - Document Indexing for AI Context (Priority: P2)

When a user creates or updates a document, the system automatically processes the content for search and AI context retrieval. This happens invisibly in the background, ensuring AI agents can access optimal context when responding to user queries.

**Why this priority**: This is the bridge between the file system and AI capabilities. While not immediately visible to users, it's essential for delivering the core value proposition of "context-aware AI". Can be developed in parallel with UI features.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating documents with distinct content, waiting for background indexing, then using search functionality to verify content is discoverable. Delivers the foundation for AI-powered features.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user creates a new document with content, **When** the auto-save triggers, **Then** the document is queued for background indexing within 5 seconds
2. **Given** a document is queued for indexing, **When** the background processor runs, **Then** the content is chunked into searchable segments and stored for retrieval
3. **Given** a user updates an existing document, **When** the changes are saved, **Then** the document's search index is updated to reflect the new content
4. **Given** a user deletes a document, **When** the deletion is confirmed, **Then** all associated index data is removed from the search system

---

### User Story 6 - Full-Text Search Across Documents (Priority: P3)

A user with many documents wants to find specific information. They use the search feature to query across all their documents and receive ranked results with highlighted matches, allowing them to quickly locate relevant content.

**Why this priority**: Search becomes valuable once users have accumulated multiple documents. While important for long-term usability, the feature can be delivered after users can create and organize their initial document base.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating multiple documents with different content, performing various search queries, and verifying results are relevant and ranked appropriately. Delivers a complete search experience.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has multiple indexed documents, **When** they enter a search query, **Then** results are returned in under 1 second ranked by relevance
2. **Given** search results are displayed, **When** a user clicks on a result, **Then** the document opens with the matching text highlighted
3. **Given** a user searches for text that exists in multiple documents, **When** results are shown, **Then** matches in document titles are ranked higher than body text matches
4. **Given** a user searches for text that doesn't exist in any document, **When** results are shown, **Then** an empty state message guides them to refine their query

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when a user loses network connection while editing?** Changes continue to queue locally and sync when connection is restored, with conflict resolution if document was modified elsewhere
- **How does system handle very large files (>10MB)?** System warns users and either prevents upload or implements progressive loading for performance
- **What happens when a user tries to create a file/folder with duplicate names?** System appends a number (e.g., "Document (1)") or prompts user to choose a different name
- **How does system handle special characters in file names?** System sanitizes names to prevent filesystem conflicts (e.g., replaces `/` with `-`)
- **What happens when document indexing fails?** System retries up to 3 times with exponential backoff, then logs error and notifies user via UI message
- **How does system handle concurrent edits to the same document?** Last-write-wins for MVP, with future consideration for operational transforms or CRDTs
- **What happens when a user's storage quota is exceeded?** System prevents new document creation and displays quota warning with upgrade prompt
- **How does system handle markdown rendering errors?** Displays sanitized content with error indicator, preventing XSS while maintaining usability

## Assumptions

- Users will primarily create text-based markdown documents, not large binary files
- Maximum individual document size will be reasonable (<10MB) for in-browser editing
- Users understand basic markdown syntax or will learn through the formatting toolbar
- Network latency for API requests will be <500ms under normal conditions
- Users will organize documents into folders rather than maintaining flat structure
- Search relevance ranking by title > headers > body will meet user expectations
- Auto-save interval of 3 seconds balances UX (no data loss) with backend load
- Mobile users will tolerate single-panel focus view rather than attempting multi-panel complexity
- Document content will be primarily English for MVP (affects search stemming and language detection)
- Users will not require real-time collaborative editing in MVP (deferred to future versions)

## Dependencies

- Authentication system must be operational to enforce user isolation and document ownership
- Backend storage system must support hierarchical folder structures
- Backend must provide endpoints for CRUD operations on documents and folders
- Full-text search indexing requires background job processing capability
- Real-time updates may require websocket or polling infrastructure for save status
- Markdown rendering library must sanitize content to prevent XSS
- Rich text editor component must support extensibility for future diff/merge UI

## Out of Scope (Post-MVP)

- Document version history and rollback capability
- Real-time collaborative editing with multiple users
- Document sharing and permissions (public links, team access)
- Document templates and boilerplates
- Export to other formats (PDF, DOCX, HTML)
- Advanced markdown features (math equations, diagrams, embeds)
- AI-suggested edits with inline diff view (UI foundation established, but feature deferred)
- Document tagging and advanced metadata
- Bulk operations (move multiple files, batch delete)
- Trash/recycle bin with recovery
- File upload from local filesystem (copy-paste, drag-drop of external files)
- Custom themes and editor preferences
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks in editor mode
