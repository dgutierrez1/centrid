# Specification Quality Checklist: File System & Markdown Editor with AI Context Management

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Validation Notes**:
- Spec successfully avoids implementation details (no mention of specific libraries, frameworks)
- Content focuses on "what" and "why" rather than "how"
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, UI/UX Requirements) are complete

---

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Validation Notes**:
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements use reasonable defaults
- All 20 functional requirements are testable with clear acceptance criteria
- Success criteria include specific metrics (e.g., "within 3 seconds", "99%+ reliability", "under 1 second")
- Success criteria avoid implementation details (focused on user-facing outcomes)
- All 6 user stories have detailed acceptance scenarios
- 8 edge cases identified with resolution strategies
- Out of Scope section clearly bounds what's excluded from MVP
- Dependencies section lists 7 required capabilities
- Assumptions section documents 10 reasonable defaults

---

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Validation Notes**:
- Each of the 6 user stories maps to multiple functional requirements
- Primary flows covered: document creation/editing (P1), file organization (P1), workspace layout (P1), mobile adaptation (P2), indexing (P2), search (P3)
- 10 success criteria align with functional requirements
- Spec maintains technology-agnostic language throughout

---

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: âœ… READY FOR PLANNING

**Summary**: The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`. All validation criteria pass without requiring spec updates.

**Strengths**:
- Well-prioritized user stories with clear independent test criteria
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Clear distinction between MVP scope and post-MVP features
- Strong focus on user value (auto-save, context management, offline support)
- Measurable, technology-agnostic success criteria

**Notes for Planning Phase**:
- Consider breaking P1 stories into separate implementation phases (editor first, then file tree, then layout)
- Document indexing (P2) can run in parallel with UI development
- Mobile interface (P2) can be deferred until desktop MVP is validated
