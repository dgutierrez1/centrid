# Tasks: File System & Markdown Editor with AI Context Management

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-filesystem-markdown-editor/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Not explicitly requested in specification - focusing on implementation tasks only

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions (Monorepo)

- **Frontend**: `apps/web/src/`
- **Backend**: `apps/api/src/`
- **Shared**: `packages/shared/src/`
- **UI Components**: `packages/ui/src/`

- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-9)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories (can run parallel to US1)
  - **User Story 3 (P1)**: Depends on US1 and US2 (integrates FileTreeContainer and DocumentEditor)
  - **User Story 4 (P2)**: Depends on US1, US2, US3 (adapts desktop layout for mobile)
  - **User Story 5 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories (can run parallel to US1-4)
  - **User Story 6 (P2)**: Depends on US2 (uses file tree and folder structure)

4. Phase 4: User Story 2 (T032-T045) - Can start after Phase 2 (parallel to US1)
5. Phase 5: User Story 3 (T046-T053) - Requires US1 and US2 complete
6. MVP READY - Stop here for initial release

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Independent - Can start immediately after Foundational
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Independent - Can start immediately after Foundational (parallel to US1)

1. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T005)
2. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T006-T021) - **CRITICAL BLOCKING PHASE**
3. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T022-T031) - Create/Edit capability
4. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (T032-T045) - File organization (can run parallel to US1)
5. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (T046-T053) - Desktop workspace

- Phase 10 (Polish): 11 tasks

**MVP Scope** (P1 only): 53 tasks (T001-T053)
**Full Feature**: 115 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**:

- Setup: 3 parallel tasks
- Foundational: 6 parallel tasks
- User Story 1: 3 parallel tasks
- User Story 2: 3 parallel tasks
- User Story 3: 3 parallel tasks
- User Story 4: 3 parallel tasks
- User Story 5: 3 parallel tasks
- User Story 6: 3 parallel tasks
- User Story 7: 3 parallel tasks
- Polish: 6 parallel tasks
- **User Story 1 + User Story 2 can run completely in parallel** (28 tasks)
- **User Story 5 can run parallel to US1-4** (12 tasks)

**Independent Test Criteria**:

- US1: Create document ‚Üí Edit with formatting ‚Üí Close browser ‚Üí Reopen ‚Üí Content persists ‚úì
- US2: Create folders ‚Üí Move files ‚Üí Rename items ‚Üí Tree updates correctly ‚úì
- US3: Desktop browser ‚Üí See three panels ‚Üí All panels functional ‚úì
- US4: Mobile browser ‚Üí Toggle views ‚Üí Access file tree menu ‚úì
- US5: Create documents ‚Üí Wait for indexing ‚Üí Search finds content ‚úì
- US6: Upload files ‚Üí Appear in tree ‚Üí Searchable ‚úì
- US7: Search query ‚Üí Results appear <1s ‚Üí Click opens with highlights ‚úì

**Suggested MVP Path**: Complete T001-T053 (Phases 1-5) for core P1 features, validate independently, then iterate with P2/P3 stories based on user feedback.

## Notes

- All tasks follow strict checklist format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies within their phase
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Edge Function-First Security: All mutations go through backend Edge Functions (no direct client Storage access)
- Server-Controlled Fields: IDs, user_id, storage_path, path, version all generated/computed server-side
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
