# Specification Quality Checklist: Backend MVP Setup & Structure

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`).

### Content Quality Review

- **No implementation details**: Specification focuses on setup/configuration requirements without prescribing specific code implementations
- **User value focused**: Developer experience and productivity are the primary drivers
- **Non-technical language**: While this is a technical setup feature, the spec focuses on WHAT needs to be configured, not HOW
- **Complete sections**: All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are present

### Requirement Completeness Review

- **No clarification markers**: All requirements are clearly defined using Drizzle ORM as the migration tool
- **Testable requirements**: Each FR can be verified (e.g., FR-001 testable by checking schema file exists, FR-002 by running migration script)
- **Measurable success criteria**: SC-001 through SC-006 all have specific metrics (table creation, type safety, performance)
- **Technology-agnostic criteria**: Success criteria focus on outcomes (migration success, type safety, query performance) not implementation details
- **Complete scenarios**: Each user story has Given/When/Then acceptance scenarios
- **Edge cases identified**: Migration failures, schema drift, RLS policy management, connection pooling addressed
- **Clear scope**: Out of Scope section explicitly excludes local dev setup, OAuth, monitoring, payments, vector search, real-time
- **Dependencies listed**: Existing Supabase project, monorepo structure, npm identified

### Feature Readiness Review

- **Requirements with acceptance criteria**: All 10 FRs map to testable acceptance scenarios in user stories
- **User scenarios complete**: Two prioritized stories (P1: Drizzle Schema, P2: Edge Functions) cover database and function setup
- **Success criteria aligned**: SC-001 through SC-006 directly support the functional requirements
- **No implementation leakage**: Specification describes structure and configuration without dictating implementation approach

## Notes

This specification is optimally scoped for MVP backend setup using **Drizzle ORM**. It focuses exclusively on database schema definition and Edge Functions structure, avoiding feature implementation details.

**Key Decisions**:
- **Drizzle ORM** for type-safe schema definition and migrations
- **Script-based migrations** using `tsx apps/api/src/db/migrate.ts`
- **No local dev setup** (already exists)
- **Current environment focus** (not fresh install)

The spec successfully cuts scope from the original architecture document by:
- Removing local development environment setup (already exists)
- Removing fresh install requirements (works in current environment)
- Deferring Supabase configuration (already exists)
- Deferring OAuth/social auth to post-MVP
- Removing monitoring/analytics setup
- Deferring payment integration
- Removing vector embeddings/semantic search
- Removing real-time subscriptions
- Excluding Edge Function feature implementations (structure only)

Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` for implementation planning.
