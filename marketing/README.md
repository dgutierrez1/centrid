# Centrid Marketing: First Paying Customers

> **Goal**: Get 1-5 paying customers in 14 days through direct outreach. Prove someone will pay before scaling.

---

## Value Proposition

**One-Liner**: "Stop re-explaining context every conversation. AI for knowledge work with persistent context."

**The Problem**: ChatGPT/Claude users waste 10-15 min per conversation re-uploading documents and re-explaining context.

**The Solution**: Upload documents once, access across unlimited AI chats. Persistent knowledge graph via RAG (pgvector).

**vs ChatGPT**: ChatGPT loses context between conversations. Centrid remembers your entire knowledge base forever.

---

## Target Customer Profile

1. Content creators managing research across multiple projects
2. Consultants working with client documents + AI insights

5. Technical writers using AI for documentation

**Ideal Customer**:

## 14-Day Execution Plan

### Days 1-2: Build Target List (50 prospects)

**Create spreadsheet**:
```
Name | Platform | Profile URL | Pain Quote | Status | Response | Result
```

**Where to Find Them**:

**Twitter** (20 prospects):
- Search: "ChatGPT context"
- Search: "tired of re-explaining"
- Search: "copy paste ChatGPT"
- Search: "ChatGPT loses context"
- Find users actively complaining about context issues

**Reddit** (15 prospects):
- r/ChatGPT - context limitation complaints
- r/ClaudeAI - context management discussions
- r/productivity - "AI workflow" posts
- Look for recent posts (last 30 days)

**LinkedIn** (15 prospects):
- Search: "Consultant" + "AI tools"
- Search: "Content Creator" + "ChatGPT"
- Filter by 2nd connections (easier outreach)

### Days 3-5: Outreach Wave 1 (20 people)

**DM Template** (customize per person):

```
Hey [Name],

Saw your [tweet/post] about [specific pain]. I built something for this.

Persistent document context across unlimited AI chats - upload once, never re-explain. Like ChatGPT that actually remembers your docs.

7-day free trial, no credit card. Would you try it?

[Link to 90-sec Loom demo]

- Daniel
```

**Critical Rules**:
- Mention their SPECIFIC pain (use quote from their post)
- Keep under 50 words
- No credit card for trial (remove friction)
- Include demo link (show don't tell)
- Send between 9am-11am or 2pm-4pm (best response times)

### Days 3-5: Create Demo Video

**90-Second Loom Script**:

1. **0-15sec**: "Hey, I'm Daniel. I built Centrid because I'm tired of re-explaining context to ChatGPT."
2. **15-45sec**: [Show the pain] Open ChatGPT, copy-paste same document 3 times in different chats, show context loss
3. **45-75sec**: [Show Centrid] Upload docs once → Create 3 different chats → Each has full document context → Never re-explain
4. **75-90sec**: "7-day free trial, no credit card. Then $25/month if it saves you time. Link in DM. Questions? Just reply."

**Recording Tips**:
- Use Loom desktop app
- Show real use case (your own documents)
- Keep it authentic (no fancy editing)
- Emphasize the pain → solution contrast

### Days 6-8: Follow-ups + Conversations

**Follow-up** (48 hours after first message):
```
Curious if you saw this? No worries if not interested.
```

**If they respond positively**:
```
Awesome! Here's the signup link: [link]

Takes 2 min to upload your first doc. Let me know if anything's confusing - I'm here to help!
```

**If they ask questions**:
- Answer immediately (within 2 hours)
- Be helpful, not salesy
- Offer to do a quick call if needed

### Days 9-10: Outreach Wave 2 (30 people)

**Refine based on Wave 1**:
- Which messaging got best response rate?
- What objections came up?
- Adjust demo based on questions
- Try different positioning variations

**Positioning Tests**:

**Option A - Pain-First**:
"Tired of re-explaining context every time? Upload docs once, access across unlimited AI chats."

**Option B - vs ChatGPT**:
"ChatGPT forces you to re-explain context every conversation. Centrid: upload once, use forever."

**Option C - Time Savings**:
"Stop wasting 15 min/day re-uploading docs to ChatGPT. Persistent context across all chats."

**Track which converts best.**

### Days 11-14: Close First Customers

**When someone signs up**:

**Day 0** (immediate):
```
Welcome to Centrid! 🎉

Quick start:
1. Upload your first document (top right)
2. Create a chat
3. Ask AI anything about your doc

Questions? Reply anytime.
```

**Day 1** (24h follow-up):
```
How's it going? Anything confusing?

Pro tip: Upload multiple docs - AI can reference all of them in any chat.
```

**Day 2** (48h):
```
Created anything useful yet? Would love to hear what you're working on!
```

**Day 7** (trial ending):
```
Your trial ends tomorrow.

Was it worth the $25/month? If you found it useful, upgrade here: [link]

If not, no worries - what would make it more valuable to you?
```

**Pricing Strategy**:
- Start at $25/month (test willingness to pay)

## Critical Questions to Answer

**Document every conversation to learn**:

1. **Pain Language**: What exact words do they use to describe their pain?
2. **Top Objection**: What's the #1 reason they don't pay?
3. **Positioning**: Which message resonates most?
4. **Minimum Value**: What features do they actually need vs nice-to-have?
5. **Willingness to Pay**: Is $25/month acceptable? Too high? Too low?

**Keep a learnings doc** (`marketing/learnings.md`):
- Every objection
- Every "yes" moment
- Feature requests
- Pricing feedback
- Competitive comparisons they mention

This intel drives Stage 2 (scaling to $1K MRR).
