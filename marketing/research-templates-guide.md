**How to run**:

1. **Copy the template** to a new file: `competitor-analysis-[date].md`
2. **Use AI browser** to execute the search prompts in the template
3. **Fill in the matrix** with findings from searches
4. **Extract exact quotes** from user reviews/complaints
5. **Analyze findings** and develop actionable insights
6. **Share with team** and update positioning/messaging

**Time required**: 2-3 hours (one-time, refresh quarterly)

**Output**:
- Competitive landscape map
- Feature comparison table
- Pricing analysis
- Competitive moat validation

### Step 2: Pain Validation (Run Monthly)

**File**: `pain-validation-template.md`

**What it does**:
- Finds real users complaining about pains Centrid solves
- Extracts EXACT quotes from Reddit, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Hacker News
- Validates pain intensity and frequency
- Develops specific marketing strategies for each validated pain
- Identifies communities and influencers to engage

**How to run**:

1. **Copy the template** to a new file: `pain-validation-[date].md`
2. **Execute searches** using AI browser with prompts from template
3. **Copy EXACT quotes** from high-engagement posts (with full context)
4. **Analyze each pain point**:
   - Frequency (how often mentioned)
   - Intensity (how urgent the pain)
   - Economic impact (time/money lost)
   - Emotional drivers (frustration/fear/guilt)
5. **Develop marketing strategies** for each validated pain:
   - Content (blog posts, social media)
   - Community engagement (Reddit, Twitter)
   - Paid ads (Google, Reddit, Twitter)
   - Product messaging (feature highlights)
6. **Take action** on immediate next steps

**Time required**: 3-4 hours (monthly refresh)

**Output**:
- Validated pain points with exact user quotes

## Tips for Effective Research

### Finding High-Value Quotes

**Look for**:
- High upvotes/engagement (500+ on Reddit, 100+ likes on Twitter)
- Detailed pain descriptions (not just "this sucks")
- Emotional language ("frustrated", "annoyed", "wish I could")
- Specific examples ("I waste 10 minutes...", "Every time I...")
- Professional context (consultants, researchers, analysts)

**Avoid**:
- Vague complaints without specifics
- Low engagement (may not represent broader pain)
- Off-topic discussions
- Trolling or non-genuine complaints

---

### Community Engagement Best Practices

**DO**:
- ✅ Share genuine value first (tips, workarounds, insights)
- ✅ Empathize with the pain ("I felt this too...")
- ✅ Mention Centrid only when directly relevant
- ✅ Be transparent about being the founder/team
- ✅ Respond to questions honestly (even about limitations)
- ✅ Follow subreddit/platform rules

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Spam every thread mentioning AI
- ❌ Lead with "Try our product!"
- ❌ Overpromise or mislead
- ❌ Ignore follow-up questions
- ❌ Break community rules (instant ban)
- ❌ Use fake accounts or sock puppets

---

### Refining Messaging from User Language

**Before (Product Jargon)**:
- "Cross-conversation context persistence with provenance-tracked artifacts"
- "Dynamic branching DAG with parent-child inheritance"
- "Multi-domain knowledge graph assembly"

**After (User Language from Quotes)**:
- "Stop copy-pasting the same context between chats"
- "Branch naturally. AI tracks all threads."
- "Your breakthrough in Chat 1 stays with you in Chat 4"

**Action**: Every time you find a user quote, extract the language and replace jargon in your messaging.
