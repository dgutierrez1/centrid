## Pain Language

**What exact words do customers use to describe their problem?**

| Date | Customer | Pain Quote | Source |
|------|----------|------------|--------|
| 2025-01-20 | Customer A | "I waste 10 minutes every day copying my research docs to ChatGPT" | Twitter DM |
| | | | |

**Common Themes**:
- [ ] Time waste (copy-pasting)
- [ ] Context loss between conversations
- [ ] Can't find old ChatGPT threads
- [ ] Inconsistent AI responses without context
- [ ] Mobile friction (hard to upload on phone)

---

## Objections

**Why do people NOT convert?**

| Date | Objection | Frequency | Response That Worked |
|------|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| 2025-01-20 | "Already using ChatGPT Plus, why add another tool?" | ||||| | "Centrid complements ChatGPT - keeps your docs accessible forever" |
| | | | |

**Top 3 Objections** (update weekly):

## "Yes" Moments

| Date | Customer | Trigger Quote | Context |
|------|----------|---------------|---------|
| 2025-01-20 | Customer B | "Oh wow, so I never have to re-upload my project docs?" | After seeing demo |
| | | | |

**Patterns**:
- Demo video (seeing it vs reading about it)
- Specific use case match (their docs + their workflow)
- Price anchor ("$25 is less than I waste in time")
- Social proof (other customers like them)

| Date | Customer | Request | Priority | Notes |
|------|----------|---------|----------|-------|
| 2025-01-20 | Customer C | "Can it summarize multiple docs at once?" | High | Common request |
| | | | | |

**Categories**:
- **Critical** (mentioned by 3+ customers, blocks conversion)
- **High** (mentioned by 2+ customers, would increase value)
- **Nice to Have** (mentioned once, defer)

---

## Pricing Feedback

**How do they react to $25/month?**

| Date | Customer | Reaction | Outcome |
|------|----------|----------|---------|
| 2025-01-20 | Customer D | "Bit high, I already pay $20 for ChatGPT Plus" | Didn't convert |
| 2025-01-21 | Customer E | "Totally worth it if it saves me time" | Paid immediately |

**Price Tests**:
- $19/month: __ conversions
- $25/month: __ conversions
