## Mindset Reminders

**When you feel discouraged**:
- âœ… Every "no" gets you closer to "yes"
- âœ… 20% response rate is GOOD for cold outreach
- âœ… First customer is hardest, it gets easier
- âœ… Learning is success even if they don't convert
- âœ… 1 paying customer proves the concept

**When you feel overwhelmed**:
- âœ… Just do today's checklist
- âœ… 2 hours/day is enough
- âœ… Focus on conversations, not volume
- âœ… Quality > Quantity

**When you feel like quitting**:
- âœ… Talk to ONE more person
- âœ… Make ONE more improvement
- âœ… Test ONE more variation
- âœ… Then decide

**Print this checklist. Check boxes daily. Ship first customer. ðŸš€**
