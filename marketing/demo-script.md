## 90-Second Script

### Section 1: Hook (0-15 seconds)

**On camera** (show your face):

```
"Hey, I'm Daniel. I built Centrid because I was tired of wasting
15 minutes every day re-explaining context to ChatGPT."
```

**OR** (screen share only):

```
"If you use ChatGPT daily, you know this pain: constantly
re-uploading documents and re-explaining context every single conversation."
```

---

### Section 2: Show the Pain (15-45 seconds)

**Screen share: ChatGPT**

**Action**: Show the frustrating workflow:

1. **Open ChatGPT Chat #1**
   ```
   "Let me show you. I'm working on a product feature."
   ```
   - Copy-paste from product spec doc
   - Copy-paste from user research
   - Ask ChatGPT a question
   - Get response

2. **Open ChatGPT Chat #2** (new conversation)
   ```
   "Later, I want to ask about pricing for this feature.
   But it's a new chat... so ChatGPT forgot everything."
   ```
   - Show ChatGPT has no context
   - Copy-paste SAME documents again
   - Ask pricing question

3. **Open ChatGPT Chat #3** (new conversation)
   ```
   "And if I want to discuss marketing? Copy-paste again."
   ```
   - Show the repetitive copy-paste
   - Emphasize time waste

**Tone**: Frustrated but not whiny. Matter-of-fact.

---

### Section 3: Show the Solution (45-75 seconds)

**Screen share: Centrid**

**Action**: Show how Centrid solves this:

1. **Upload Documents** (5 seconds)
   ```
   "Here's Centrid. First, I upload my documents once."
   ```
   - Click upload button
   - Select 2-3 files
   - Show upload progress
   - "Done. Never have to re-upload these."

2. **Create Multiple Chats** (10 seconds)
   ```
   "Now I can create unlimited chats, and they ALL have access
   to these documents."
   ```
   - Create Chat 1: "Feature Discussion"
   - Create Chat 2: "Pricing Strategy"
   - Create Chat 3: "Marketing Ideas"

3. **Show Persistent Context** (10 seconds)
   ```
   "Watch: In every chat, the AI already knows my documents."
   ```
   - Open Chat 1, ask feature question → AI responds with context
   - Open Chat 2, ask pricing question → AI responds with context
   - Open Chat 3, ask marketing question → AI responds with context
   - No copy-pasting needed

4. **Highlight Key Benefit** (5 seconds)
   ```
   "Upload once. Access everywhere. Never re-explain context."
   ```
   - Show document list sidebar
   - Show multiple active chats
   - Show AI has full knowledge base

---

### Section 4: Call to Action (75-90 seconds)

**On camera OR screen share**:

```
"7-day free trial, no credit card required.

If it saves you time, it's $25/month.

Link in the DM. Questions? Just reply.

I'm here to help."
```

**Show**:
- Signup page (briefly)
- "See you inside"

## Recording Tips

### Do's

✅ **Keep it casual** - Authenticity > polish
✅ **Show real frustration** - Make the pain relatable
✅ **Use your real docs** - Viewers connect with real use cases
✅ **Speak clearly but naturally** - Conversational tone
✅ **Show, don't tell** - More screen time, less talking
✅ **Keep moving** - No long pauses, maintain energy
✅ **End with clear CTA** - Tell them exactly what to do next

### Don'ts

❌ **Don't over-script** - Sounds robotic
❌ **Don't apologize for mistakes** - Just re-record that section
❌ **Don't use fake data** - Viewers can tell
❌ **Don't rush** - Speak at normal pace
❌ **Don't sell too hard** - Show value, it sells itself
❌ **Don't make it longer than 90 sec** - People's attention span

## Alternative Script (More Technical)

**For Hacker News / Developer Audience**

### Hook (0-10 sec)
```
"Built Centrid to solve persistent context in AI chat.
Let me show you the architecture."
```

### Pain (10-30 sec)
```
"ChatGPT loses context between conversations. You can upload
files, but every new chat starts from zero. For knowledge work,
this breaks the workflow."
```

### Solution (30-75 sec)
```
"Centrid uses RAG with pgvector. Upload documents once, they're
chunked and embedded. Every chat retrieves relevant chunks via
semantic search. Multi-chat system with shared knowledge base.

[Show: Upload → Vector embedding → Multiple chats → Context retrieval]

Tech stack: Next.js, Supabase, pgvector, real-time subscriptions.

It's like giving ChatGPT a persistent memory of your entire
knowledge base."
```

### CTA (75-90 sec)
```
"Try it: [link]
Open source coming soon. Happy to answer questions about the
RAG implementation."
```

## Recording Workflow

1. **Record 3-5 takes**
   - First take: Get comfortable
   - Second take: Better delivery
   - Third take: Usually the keeper
   - More if needed

2. **Pick best take** (don't overthink it)
   - Clear audio?
   - Smooth demo?
   - Natural delivery?
   - Under 90 seconds?

3. **Trim if needed** (Loom built-in editor)
   - Remove long pauses
   - Cut rambling sections
   - Keep it tight

4. **Test before sending**
   - Watch it once
   - Would YOU click through?
   - Is CTA clear?

---

## Loom Settings

**Before recording**:
- Video: Camera + Screen
- Audio: Check mic levels
- Size: Full screen
- Quality: Auto (720p is fine)

**After recording**:
- Thumbnail: Pick frame where you look engaged
- Title: "How Centrid Solves Context Loss in ChatGPT"
- Settings: Enable "Require email to view" = OFF (remove friction)
- CTA: Add button at end with signup link

---

## Distribution

**Use this video**:
1. Direct DMs (Twitter, Reddit, LinkedIn)
2. Landing page hero section
3. Product Hunt launch
4. Hacker News Show HN post
5. Email signature
6. Social posts

**One video. Multiple uses.**

---

## Success Criteria

**Good demo video**:
- [ ] Under 90 seconds
- [ ] Shows clear pain → solution
- [ ] Uses real documents/use cases
- [ ] Authentic delivery (not salesy)
- [ ] Clear CTA
- [ ] Good audio quality
- [ ] Viewer can understand value in <30 seconds

**Great demo video**:
- [ ] All above +
- [ ] Viewer thinks "That's exactly my problem"
- [ ] Specific use case they relate to
- [ ] Makes them want to try it immediately
- [ ] Answers obvious objections before they ask

---

## Quick Test

**Before you send to prospects**:

1. **Show to a friend** (not in AI/tech):
   - "Can you explain what this product does?"
   - "Would you try it?"
   - "What's confusing?"

2. **Show to a potential customer**:
   - "Does this solve a problem you have?"
   - "What would make this more valuable?"

3. **Watch it yourself**:
   - "Would I click through?"
   - "Is the value obvious?"

**If all 3 say yes → Ship it.**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ❌ **Too long** (>2 min = people drop off)
2. ❌ **Too much talking, not enough showing** (show screens!)
3. ❌ **Skipping the pain** (viewers need to feel the problem)
4. ❌ **Fake/staged demo** (use YOUR real docs)
5. ❌ **Unclear CTA** (what should they do next?)
6. ❌ **Perfect delivery focus** (authentic > polished)
7. ❌ **No urgency** (why try it NOW vs later?)

---

**Ready? Record your first take now. Don't overthink it. Ship v1, iterate based on feedback.**
