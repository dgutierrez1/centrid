## Quick Response Templates

**When they respond positively**:
```
Awesome! Here's the link: [signup]

Takes 2 min to upload first doc. Questions? I'm here.
```

**When they ask "How is this different from ChatGPT?"**:
```
Great question!

ChatGPT: Upload docs in each chat, loses context between conversations
Centrid: Upload once, access across ALL chats forever

It's like ChatGPT but it actually remembers your knowledge base.

Try it: [link]
```

**When they ask about pricing**:
```
7-day free trial (no credit card).

After trial: $25/month.

[For first 3 customers]: You're one of my first users - I can do $19/month lifetime if you find it valuable.
```

**When they ask "What if I already use ChatGPT Plus?"**:
```
You can keep using ChatGPT Plus!

Centrid is for when you have documents/research you reference constantly. Instead of copy-pasting to ChatGPT every time, upload once and it's available forever.

Think: project docs, research papers, client files, knowledge bases.
```

**When they don't respond (48h follow-up)**:
```
Curious if you saw this? No worries if not interested.
```

**When they say "Not right now"**:
```
Totally understand!

Mind if I ask - is it timing, or is there something that would make it more useful?

Either way, thanks for the reply!
```
