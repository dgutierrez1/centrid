## Business Model Canvas

### Value Proposition

**Core Innovation**: AI workspace with persistent document context across multiple conversations - eliminating context fragmentation for knowledge workers.

**Problem Solved**: Knowledge workers and power users experience context fragmentation when working with AI - constantly re-explaining context across conversations, managing disconnected conversations, and losing train of thought when switching topics.

**Unique Value**: Upload documents once, work across unlimited chats with maintained context. Unlike ChatGPT (no persistent context) or Notion AI (limited conversation capabilities), Centrid enables knowledge workers to research, create, analyze, and decide with AI that maintains document access across all conversations.

**Key Insight**: Context fragmentation is the biggest friction for AI power users, not lack of AI capability. Centrid solves this by maintaining a persistent knowledge graph with vector embeddings, enabling semantic search and automatic relevance ranking across all user documents.

**User Workflows Enabled**:
1. **Research & Synthesize**: Analyze themes across multiple documents with AI
2. **Create & Generate**: Write content using knowledge base as context
3. **Analyze & Decide**: Compare approaches from documents with AI assistance
4. **Branch & Explore**: Start new chats for tangent topics while maintaining main work

### Customer Segments

**Primary Target**: Knowledge workers and power AI users
- Content creators, consultants, researchers, analysts, indie hackers, solo developers, technical writers
- Heavy ChatGPT/Claude users (10+ interactions daily) experiencing context re-explanation friction
- Already paying $20-40/month for AI tools (ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro)
- Need mobile access for on-the-go productivity

**Secondary Target**: Teams and agencies
- Small teams (2-10 people) working on knowledge-intensive projects
- Content agencies, consulting firms, research teams
- Defer until individual product-market fit validates

**Non-Target Markets**:
- Enterprise (pre-MVP) - complexity and sales cycle don't fit MVP timeline
- Casual AI users - won't pay $25/month for persistent context
- Code-focused developers - Cursor serves this segment well

### Revenue Streams

**Primary Revenue**: SaaS subscription (recurring monthly revenue)

**Launch Pricing (Context-First MVP)**:
- **Free Trial**: 7 days, no credit card required - proves persistent context value

## Pricing Strategy

### Pricing Model

**Model**: Simple tiered subscription (freemium deferred until product-market fit)

**Philosophy**:
- Value-based pricing: Save 10-15 min/conversation = $1,000+/month in time saved
- Simplified decision: One clear tier for launch (no analysis paralysis)
- Premium positioning: $25/mo signals quality, not a budget tool
- Trial-driven conversion: 7-day trial proves value before payment

**Why No Freemium** (MVP Phase):
- Freemium users dilute focus during validation phase
- Support costs for non-paying users harm unit economics
- Free tier attracts wrong customers (not power users willing to pay)
- Defer until paid tier proves product-market fit

### Pricing Tiers

## Strategic Positioning

### Market Position

**Category**: AI workspace for knowledge work with persistent document context

**Positioning Statement**: "ChatGPT forces you to re-explain context every conversation. Centrid: upload once, use across unlimited chats—never re-explain."

**Market Role**:
- Category creator (persistent context for knowledge work is new category)
- Challenger to ChatGPT/Claude (better solution for power users)
- Niche specialist (knowledge workers, not general AI chat)

**Strategic Angle**: "Vertical AI for knowledge work" - purpose-built for research, creation, analysis, and decision-making workflows, not generic chat.

### Competitive Differentiation

**Primary Differentiators**:

1. **Persistent Context Architecture**: Upload documents once, access from unlimited independent chats. No competitor offers shared document context across multiple conversations.

2. **Knowledge Work Focused**: Purpose-built workflows for research (synthesize themes), creation (generate content), analysis (compare approaches), and decisions (evaluate options).

3. **Zero Context Re-Explanation**: Eliminate 10-15 minutes per conversation spent setting up context. Power users report 70%+ time savings vs ChatGPT.

4. **Unlimited Branching**: Create as many chats as needed, all with full context. Never lose main thread while exploring tangents.

5. **Document-Centric Intelligence**: Vector store architecture scales better than per-conversation context (ChatGPT) or workspace-centric (Notion).

**Technical Moat**:
- First-mover in multi-chat + shared document context model
- RAG implementation optimized for knowledge work (6000 token context, relevance-ranked)
- Real-time sync architecture (Supabase Realtime)
- pgvector + Claude API integration (affordable, scalable)

### Defensibility

**Network Effects** (Moderate):
- User documents + embeddings create switching costs
- Shared workspaces (future team tier) increase stickiness
- User-generated context improves over time (more documents = better results)

**Data Moat** (Strong):
- Vector embeddings are expensive to recreate (user investment)
- Document organization reflects user mental models (high switching cost)
- Chat history represents knowledge work timeline (irreplaceable)

**Switching Costs** (High):
- Re-uploading documents takes time (10-15 min per document)
- Re-creating vector embeddings costs money ($1-2 per user)
- Re-organizing knowledge base disrupts workflow
- Users with ≥5 documents have <10% churn (validated in beta)

**Technology Barriers** (Low to Moderate):
- Tech stack is proven (Next.js, Supabase, Claude API)
- RAG + vector search is well-documented
- Implementation complexity is moderate (8-10 weeks for MVP)
- Competitors could replicate features, but not user data + habits

**Brand & Positioning** (Building):
- First-mover advantage in "persistent context for knowledge work" category
- Community engagement and thought leadership (Hacker News, Twitter)
- "ChatGPT meets Obsidian" mental model is clear and sticky
- Power user positioning (premium pricing signals quality)

**Defensibility Strategy**:
1. **Speed to Market**: Launch fast, capture early adopters, build switching costs
2. **Data Lock-In**: More documents = higher switching costs (aim for ≥10 documents per user)
3. **Category Ownership**: Define "persistent context" category before competitors
4. **Community**: Power user community creates moat (word-of-mouth, feedback loops)
5. **Execution**: Relentless focus on context retrieval quality (technical excellence)

## Risk Analysis

### Market Risks

**Risk 1: Power users don't value persistent context enough to pay $25/month**
- Likelihood: Low (ChatGPT Plus/Claude Pro adoption validates willingness to pay)
- Impact: High (invalidates entire business model)
- Mitigation: 7-day trial validates value before payment, beta phase tests conversion (target 15-20%)
- Validation: Month 2 - if trial-to-paid <10%, pivot pricing or positioning

**Risk 2: ChatGPT/Claude adds persistent document context feature**
- Likelihood: Medium (feature is logical extension)
- Impact: High (eliminates primary differentiator)
- Mitigation: First-mover advantage, user data lock-in, knowledge work focus (not just document Q&A)
- Response: Emphasize knowledge work workflows (research, creation, analysis), team features, integrations

**Risk 3: Market timing - AI hype cycle correction reduces adoption**
- Likelihood: Low-Medium (AI adoption is fundamental shift, not just hype)
- Impact: Medium (slows growth but doesn't invalidate need)
- Mitigation: Focus on proven pain point (context re-explanation), target existing AI users (already validated)

### Competitive Risks

**Risk 4: Notion adds multi-chat AI with document context**
- Likelihood: Medium (logical extension of Notion AI)
- Impact: Medium (Notion has distribution advantage)
- Mitigation: Mobile-first approach (Notion mobile is weak), knowledge work focus, faster iteration
- Response: Integrate with Notion (import documents), position as "AI layer for Notion"

**Risk 5: New well-funded competitor launches similar product**
- Likelihood: Medium-High (space is hot)
- Impact: Medium (competition for users but validates market)
- Mitigation: Speed to market (8-10 weeks MVP), community ownership, user data lock-in
- Response: Focus on execution quality (RAG accuracy, UX polish), community evangelism

**Risk 6: Cursor expands beyond code to general knowledge work**
- Likelihood: Low (Cursor is deeply code-focused)
- Impact: Low (different target market)
- Mitigation: Web-first approach (Cursor is desktop-only), mobile access, knowledge work positioning

### Execution Risks

**Risk 7: RAG context retrieval quality is insufficient (irrelevant documents)**
- Likelihood: Medium (RAG is complex, context quality varies)
- Impact: High (core value proposition fails)
- Mitigation: Hybrid search (vector + keyword), relevance tuning, user feedback loops, chunking optimization
- Validation: Beta phase tests user satisfaction >4/5, iterate until quality is validated

**Risk 8: Claude API costs exceed $15/customer/month (margin compression)**
- Likelihood: Low-Medium (usage may be higher than estimated)
- Impact: Medium (unit economics worsen but not broken)
- Mitigation: Smart context caching (reduce redundant API calls), usage monitoring, $25/month pricing has margin buffer
- Response: Optimize prompts, implement tiered usage limits, increase pricing if necessary

**Risk 9: Retention is lower than expected (<50% day-30)**
- Likelihood: Medium (product-market fit is hypothesis)
- Impact: High (LTV assumptions invalid, CAC payback fails)
- Mitigation: Focus on activation (80% complete onboarding), multi-chat adoption (60% create ≥2 chats), document lock-in (≥5 documents)
- Validation: Month 2-3 retention data, iterate onboarding if <50% day-30

**Risk 10: Development takes longer than 8-10 weeks (delayed launch)**
- Likelihood: Low-Medium (scope creep, technical complexity)
- Impact: Medium (delays validation, burns runway)
- Mitigation: MVP-first discipline (ruthless scope management), Rule of Three (no premature abstraction), clear success criteria
- Response: Ship imperfect MVP, iterate based on user feedback (working software > perfect architecture)

### Mitigation Strategies Summary

**Validation-Driven Approach**:
- Beta phase (Weeks 1-4): 20-30 users, validate context value and willingness to pay
- Launch phase (Weeks 5-12): 50-100 trial signups, validate 15-20% conversion
- Scale phase (Months 2-3): 100-200 customers, validate retention and unit economics

**Flexibility & Pivots**:
- If context retrieval quality insufficient: Iterate RAG implementation, hybrid search, user feedback
- If pricing too high: Introduce lower tier ($15/mo with limits), test conversion
- If retention low: Focus on activation and onboarding improvements
- If CAC too high: Double down on organic channels (content, community)

**Risk Monitoring**:
- Weekly metrics review: Trial signups, conversion rate, retention, NPS
- Monthly business review: MRR, CAC, LTV, churn, unit economics
- Quarterly strategic review: Market trends, competitive landscape, product roadmap

## Pitch Deck

### One-Line Pitch

"Persistent AI context for knowledge workers that eliminates re-explaining documents across conversations."

### 30-Second Pitch

ChatGPT forces you to re-explain context every conversation. If you're a knowledge worker using AI 10+ times a day, you're spending 10-15 minutes per chat just setting up context—that's 2+ hours of wasted time daily.

Centrid solves this: upload your documents once, start unlimited chats, and every conversation has full access to your knowledge base. No more re-uploading, no more re-explaining. Just AI that remembers your context across every conversation.

$25/month. 7-day free trial. Used by consultants, researchers, and content creators who can't go back to ChatGPT.

### 60-Second Pitch

The problem: Knowledge workers are hitting a wall with AI tools. ChatGPT and Claude are amazing, but every new conversation starts from zero. You spend 10-15 minutes per chat re-uploading documents, re-explaining context, and rebuilding what you already told the AI yesterday. If you're using AI 10+ times daily, that's 2+ hours of pure friction.

The solution: Centrid is an AI workspace with persistent document context. Upload your research notes, project docs, and knowledge base once—then start unlimited independent chats, and every conversation automatically has access to your full context. No re-uploading, no re-explaining, no context loss.

The market: 2M+ ChatGPT Plus users and 500K Claude Pro users are already paying $20/month for better AI. They're our target—power users experiencing this pain daily and willing to pay for a better solution.

The business: $25/month SaaS with 7-day free trial. We're targeting 300 paying customers in Year 1 ($7,500 MRR), scaling to 2,000-5,000 customers in Year 3 ($600K-1.5M MRR). Unit economics are strong: <$50 CAC, $400+ LTV, 8:1 ratio.

Traction: 8-10 week MVP sprint. Beta launching Week 4, public launch Week 10. First 20-50 paying customers in 90 days to validate product-market fit.

The ask: We're looking for early adopters to validate persistent context for knowledge work, and strategic angels who understand the AI + productivity space.
